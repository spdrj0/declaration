Town Hall: but I click on on you

14
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:37.460

15
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.989

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.400
Town Hall: the mic's on.

17
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.779

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.480

Rich Caccappolo Office (9DS): Where kind of kind of

32
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.550
Evan Simeone: yeah, we can barely hear it.

33
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.769
Evan Simeone: there's audio, but it's not

34
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.419
Evan Simeone: gonna work, for it's not intelligible.

35
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.990
Town Hall: Can anyone on the zoom hear us? You're on mute?

36
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:09.309
Evan Simeone: Yes, when you're right next to the computer. We can hear you. We can. Audio is coming through, but it's unintelligible, and you're not right there. Try it again with the mike.

37
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.149
Town Hall: Can. Can you hear me now?

38
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.110
Evan Simeone: Yeah.

39
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:26.839
Town Hall: So let's so we have. But then you can hear it here as well. You have that echo which is not gonna work. That is this thing. right? But I'm talking. You can hear me here at the Echo.

40
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:37.720
Town Hall: You're you know, we have a wire size. Okay? At least it's not feedbacking. Okay. But do I have to hold? Can I hold it here? Can they hear me? Can you guys hear me now if I talk like this.

41
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.480
Town Hall: Yes.

42
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.840
Town Hall: So your mic up all the time. Okay?

43
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.800
Town Hall: And then we have to. Cumbersome. Yeah. But

44
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.780
Town Hall: yeah. I didn't.

45
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.880
Town Hall: Hello, Hello!

46
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.989
Town Hall: But if I put it here. You can't

47
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:21.169
Town Hall: too high, which gotta be like I have to hold it like this, like those Youtube view.

48
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:26.219
Town Hall: I got to put my sweater on.

49
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.220
Town Hall: He wanted giving it all up.

50
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.910
Town Hall: Okay, let's start taking seats. We're going to get started in a minute.

51
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.889
Town Hall: Yeah, I guess. So

52
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.299
Town Hall: I got very quiet very quickly.

53
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.559
Town Hall: That thing's not gonna work there. It's gonna fall.

54
00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.310
Town Hall: No, someone's guys in the front.

55
00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.139
Yes.

56
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.139
Town Hall: and is going to write it into the Google Doc.

57
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.779
Town Hall: we'll see whatever it.

58
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.070
Town Hall: Jamie, you look very nice.

59
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.399
Town Hall: Larry's by himself. You got the good seat, though.

60
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.289
Town Hall: It's like, stand up comedy.

61
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:55.480
Town Hall: Okay? 90'clock. Let's get started.

62
00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:02.059
Town Hall: Can the people on the zoom hear me when I use the microphone? Correct?

63
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.760
Marco Vigano': Yes, yes.

64
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.049
Town Hall: I was. If I told you something like, Can you hear me?

65
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:11.659
Susan Parker: No, not really.

66
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.360
Susan Parker: Okay. How about this? Is this? Okay?

67
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:29.480
Town Hall: So I don't have to do it so close I can do it here and talk lab, which I'm good at. And hopefully they can hear me. Okay. So first of all, Paul Bannister, thank you very much for hosting us.

68
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.790
Town Hall: It's a beautiful space. Thank you very much.

69
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:55.799
Town Hall:  thank you. Rich for making this happen. this is like the emergency podcast. This is like the emergency sort of zoom, a sort of zoom and and roundtable everyone together talking about artificial intelligence and how it's gonna impact the publisher world.

70
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:56.940
Town Hall: Okay.

71
00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.429
Town Hall: it's weird hearing myself interview this out. Okay, so

72
00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.389
Town Hall: we've done 26 of these

73
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.360
Town Hall: or 27. Let me go to slide.

74
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.350
Town Hall: Okay, nothing's working.

75
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.310
Town Hall: Hold on. Hold on. This was working before Anna, you and I.

76
00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:28.950
Town Hall: I got in the background there.

77
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.920
Town Hall: Oh, there we go. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you.

78
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.310
Town Hall: Yeah. So there's a couple of rules of the meeting.

79
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:57.610
Town Hall: we've done these before. it's a little bit different now for this meeting, because we have editorial people in the room, and we've never really done that before. Typically, it's only programmatic. We did some e-commerce stuff. But we're really excited to have the editor of people in the role room because it's so important. What's happening with everything? With AI,

80
00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.100
Town Hall: so

81
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:16.579
Town Hall: nothing the lawyers would cringe at. But it's the fine line where we still need to be honest with each other. Talk about what's happening, and we can pull a Mike dug in where his boss says, Don't say anything, but get as much out of the meeting as you can.

82
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.050
Town Hall: Right? That's in. We're not doing that.

83
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.609
Town Hall: I know, but that's what that's what Spani said.

84
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:43.610
Town Hall: Right? So no, that's what he said. I call I texted him. I text him. That's what he said. I asked him, okay, so we have to talk and be honest. And we're gonna grow and learn from this thing and figure out what's happening no sharing anything confidential. We do this whole thing. And then the last one here. I wrote, no writing about this content.

85
00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:58.150
Town Hall: Okay, it's sort of chatting with chat and house rules. You can talk about it. But you can't write about what we talked about here, because that goes against everything. And there's editorial people in the room. And that's why we're doing that. Okay, everybody makes sense. Everybody. Everybody gets it. Good.

86
00:37:58.850 --> 00:37:59.700
Town Hall: Okay.

87
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:21.100
Town Hall:  So this is number 26. We've been doing it for 8 years. We did the last one in February, first party data, and we didn't have one scheduled. And then we realized this, AI thing was happening when Chat Gpt went out and we decided to do an emergency meeting. Bring everyone together and have this conversation.

88
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.950
Town Hall: Okay, but it's a lot of these, and if we have to, we'll do another one in September, seeing what the outcome is

89
00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.890
Town Hall: okay.

90
00:38:31.760 --> 00:39:03.059
Town Hall: I have like a 90 page deck in here. I sort of just like to dumping stuff in. I assumed everyone was looking at it, but it's enough to facilitate the conversation. and then we'll talk about other stuff. We have no taking by Anna, and is gonna do a list of what we think the action items or next steps are. I have a list that I did of 12 before the meeting, and we'll see what comes up. Once this meeting happens, we'll go through it and see what it comes up, so we can walk away, saying, This is where I've learned what we're doing.

91
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:22.429
Town Hall: it's an honest publisher. Centric conversation about AI. The slides are to facilitate conversation. Some of them are garbage. Some are okay, like Andrew, like 2 weeks ago told me his 3 missives. I have it in there. We can talk about that or not. We'll see what happens. But we just have to get everyone to talk. Once I start shutting up.

92
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.369
Town Hall: Oh, oh, no, no, no.

93
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:46.489
Town Hall: thank you. Everyone for contributing. I only had to send out no joke. About 45 emails to everyone asking them for get their content. Okay? And it's one of my superpowers is to get content from people. So thank you. Some people did not put stuff in the deck. It's okay. They told me why I'm still gonna make them talk right. But we have to talk to be able to figure out what's happening in this world.

94
00:39:46.680 --> 00:40:03.339
Town Hall: And we're gonna start with introductions because there's new people in the room, and some people don't know everyone. And we've done so many these before, where everyone knows everyone. And since everyone does not know everyone, when do introductions, that's where we have the slides we're gonna go through. Who's in the meeting?

95
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.580
Town Hall: Who's attending what you're doing with AI right now and then? Who owns AI in the company you work for?

96
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:15.330
Town Hall: And as we go through these 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, like 15 or 16. If they get repetitive we'll skip.

97
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:22.769
Town Hall: But we're just gonna talk about it. So everybody knows every once they could be more honest and upright, and and just not me talking the entire time.

98
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.880
Town Hall: Anything else.

99
00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.860
Town Hall: No, okay.

100
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.430
Town Hall: So I wrote this like a month ago.

101
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.109
Town Hall: how AI is just changing the digital publisher landscape as we know it.

102
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:46.770
Town Hall: And I don't think it's gonna happen today. But it's gonna happen the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months, whatever it happens

103
00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:54.169
Town Hall: to me, AI is like having the smartest person you've ever worked with sitting next to you helping you do everything you're going to do?

104
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:59.829
Town Hall: it's going to fundamentally change the publisher business fundamentally change what you're laughing at. Rich.

105
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:14.439
Town Hall: Yeah. And it's there's gonna be content. There's gonna be job losses, job gains. And I think when you go through the list of the 16 publishers, everybody's doing something differently.

106
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:27.830
Town Hall: so no one knows exactly what to work on. So it's a little chaotic, but hopefully bringing everyone together. We can sort of get some consensus and go away thinking of ideas to work on.

107
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.669
Town Hall: and some of the contents

108
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:45.539
Town Hall: topics we'll discuss are on here, and if we don't get to them just we'll we'll we'll get to everything. We got 3 h hopefully. We'll break at noon, 1212, 30. We'll get to every if the one we'll figure it out

109
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.690
Town Hall: content ideation, creation getting paid for content. The Lms

110
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.700
Town Hall: homepage traffic goes down once, Google changes its algorithm.

111
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:11.119
Town Hall: Yeah. But we're going to talk about all that. Okay? And then, as someone said this, I forget. Our publisher's too big to fail.

112
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.340
Town Hall: Okay, no. It's a big no.

113
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:20.299
Town Hall: okay. Introductions in order.

114
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:24.379
Town Hall: Okay, so this is everyone who's here, I think.

115
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:28.520
Town Hall: and and typically it's programmatic.

116
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:37.039
Town Hall: But I'm programmatic. You see, it's not that much. It's a bunch of other people to have these conversations. and then we'll jump into

117
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:45.670
Town Hall: one by one. Okay, I'm going to give this to Matt Wheatland, not rich, and you have to use the microphone.

118
00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.990
Town Hall: You want to do it together.

119
00:42:51.270 --> 00:43:10.389
Town Hall:  hi, everyone. I'm Matt Wheat and chief digital officer at the email. and this is he is. He's been managing a lot of our AI initiatives today as well. And, by the way, he's this is freaking awesome, and he's probably spent more time with bar than anyone. He gets some of the best data out of it, having conversations.

120
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.650
Town Hall: And it's crazy. Especially, we'll talk about the little video you did as well.

121
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:16.840
Town Hall: yeah.

122
00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:28.210
Town Hall: I think like a lot of publishers, most of our focus has been on content today. so we've been testing video voice overs with 11 labs. so they can

123
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:40.859
Town Hall: basically give us the correct accent voice over so we could create content in the Uk in time for us to wake up, for instance, and it can help speed up video creation for shorts and tik tok

124
00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:50.330
Town Hall:  speaking to Jasper about their AI platform, and how it could help editorial. I had a couple of walkthroughs on that platform.

125
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.090
Town Hall: I think it's all right.

126
00:43:53.690 --> 00:44:02.179
Town Hall: I think we need to sort of test it more to really understand what it can do. Real quick. Andrew. Use Jasper. Right? Good, not good.

127
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:09.150
Town Hall: Great. Is anyone else using Jasper?

128
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.830
Oh, yeah. but

129
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:14.660
got it.

130
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:19.710
Town Hall: It's the AI. How is it?

131
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.940
Town Hall: It's my bad.

132
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.570
Town Hall: Okay, thanks to you. Again.

133
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:40.689
Town Hall: commerce, article creation. So for a lot of our commerce content, we are given sort of pitches along with images. fairly easy to create the content. What one thing we found with a lot of the content testing is that

134
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:58.019
Town Hall: It's not just creating the content. It's the overall workflow of then connecting that sort of pacing into our Cms. Getting to create images from the picture desk. So it's not really speed anything up right now. But you were saying right now with the content creation for e-commerce. It's actually taking more time now than it did

135
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:10.900
Town Hall: before. AI. But the hope is it's going to get way more efficient once we figure it out, and to know we haven't published a lot of this yet. We've done sort of, I guess. Dry runs and testing to see how long the process takes and what the

136
00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.179
Town Hall: copy looks like

137
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:27.589
Town Hall: SEO. So testing with bar for optimize page titles and summaries. often, we'll write a headline for the homepage, but we don't think about optimizing SEO headlines.

138
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:45.059
Town Hall:  legal. So thinking through legal ramifications both. how content is being used to create the Lms to date but then also moving forward. how publishes content will be used by AI,

139
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:48.450
Town Hall: and then Cms, we've got an in-house Bill Cms. So

140
00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:57.429
Town Hall: thinking through how we could eventually build AI functionality natively into our Cms and who owns AI in our company?

141
00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:02.350
Town Hall: I guess the CEO initiative so rich he'll pass it down to the various stakeholders.

142
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:13.409
Town Hall: Yeah. So we've been using or testing AI to see how it can

143
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:26.850
Town Hall: create captions, because some of our articles are very image heavy. And there's sort of like these vertical galleries that are in nested within an article and trying to see how we can save time from an editorial perspective and create

144
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:32.300
Town Hall: those captions and streamline workflow. So they can dedicate to creating additional content.

145
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:38.690
Town Hall: that's something that we've been testing as well.

146
00:46:38.910 --> 00:47:01.010
Town Hall: Google Demo, right? Do you want to just spend a minute talking about that? Yeah. So I was able to get into search labs, I was able to get into Google, Sg, and then compare that with Bard and see how it's met. It's showing data. And it's interesting to to see how for certain topics like more evergreen lifestyle topics it gives you. It gives you the entire answer within the Chatbot.

147
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:14.770
Town Hall: with some references to the articles that it's that it's talking about with more thorny topics, such as politics or finance, or medical, which is kind of to be expected, it will stay away from that. It will continue to serve

148
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:21.470
Town Hall: the the sites that it. Things are going to answer your question similar to how the algorithm has always worked.

149
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:28.539
Town Hall: But it won't give you any context, so it will not. It will really provide you with financial advice or medical advice

150
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.340
Town Hall: or legal liability.

151
00:47:30.490 --> 00:48:00.289
Town Hall: what? God knows. But you know it for the evergreen stuff. it's definitely suppressing the blue links, and that's where we'll talk about later. That massive decline in in search traffic is going to come in So sites that really like like boot sites or or lifestyle sites, those are really going to be impacted. And do we have any sense when the new Google search with Bard integrated will be released in the wild, I think, from what I understand is going to be later this year. So it's coming very, very soon, probably before the end of the year.

152
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:04.630
Town Hall: 2, 4.

153
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:13.999
Town Hall: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

154
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:15.890
yeah.

155
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.300
Town Hall: Okay, so

156
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:23.649
Town Hall: thank you. That was good. Okay, next we have. I believe it's.

157
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.030
yeah.

158
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:38.180
Yeah, I think the legal point breaks it to legal right?

159
00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:50.279
Town Hall: Yeah, I think efficiency ends up being a huge topic of how it goes behind editorial and everything else, and how that works which

160
00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:56.849
Town Hall: okay? Next, we have Paul Bannister, raptive, formally known as

161
00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:03.090
Town Hall: Ad. Thrive, formerly known as cafe media, the host of the event. Go ahead, Paul.

162
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:17.690
Town Hall: so I'm here. John King is here, who runs our programmatic teams. Evan Simone is on the Zoom, or chief product officer, and then an A. Blender who runs our insights, and research is here too. I'll talk for a 30 s, and then Evan will talk a bit more, because I would say.

163
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:28.969
Town Hall: well, like everyone in our company at this point owns AI, we're making a big investment in a lot of different areas, I think evidence probably the the closest to on in a number of ways. I think

164
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:52.409
Town Hall: what kick started it for us, actually as an acquisition we made about 18 months ago of a company called Topic, which is sort of a small competitor to Jasper AI, and we we took their product in house. We took their their lead engineers, and we use that now as a platform to do. You know, Article creation inspire content ideas some of the things Andrew was talking about before SEO optimization. We're building a lot on that, and that

165
00:49:52.410 --> 00:50:02.039
Town Hall: that gave us, you know, a kernel of a generative AI team internally, which is really good. And we're building and building on top of that in a lot of ways. Now. so that was sort of like the Kickstar for us, which was

166
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:07.800
Town Hall: good because we did it 18 months ago. And then we've kind of done a lot more, and I've been up and talk about some more of those details.

167
00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.110
Town Hall: Yeah. So as

168
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:28.950
Evan Simeone: As Paul mentioned this, all started with the topic acquisition. And we've been looking at using and that, you know, had early access to Gpt. There were early beta users.

169
00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:41.750
Evan Simeone: and so we've been looking at using generative AI to help creators So we work with over 4,000 independent creators. and giving them

170
00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:52.459
Evan Simeone: tools and capabilities to help boost productivity and improve quality. At first it was focused on topic, was primarily focused towards optimizing content for search.

171
00:50:52.590 --> 00:51:02.969
Evan Simeone: but more and more it's shifting to, you know, helping to as a like a writer, assistant brainstorming assistant and so forth.

172
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:16.009
Evan Simeone: and we have a product development in this area. And you know, AI based product development that spans virtually the entire product line.

173
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:28.119
Evan Simeone: so creator, facing solutions end user-facing solutions and development. many internal automation solutions that we're working on for

174
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:36.669
Evan Simeone: data and analytics and insights automated code development, which is really promising and interesting

175
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:46.879
Evan Simeone: area of of application. with the goal of, you know, improving quality and throughput

176
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:53.990
Evan Simeone: speeding product development, automating testing in ways that were never really possible before.

177
00:51:54.450 --> 00:52:10.779
Evan Simeone: we're also, you know, really engaging with our Creator base in terms of you know, education answering questions that they have. Of course, you know, it's not like, we know, all the answers and things are moving so quickly that there are many, many unknowns

178
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:13.509
Evan Simeone: but really trying to share knowledge.

179
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:23.140
Evan Simeone: and having forums for hearing feedback about concerns and questions. doing a lot internally with education. So we started this program called

180
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:36.459
Evan Simeone: AI Squared artificial Intelligence intelligence. We're providing training on multiple tracks. From the. you know, the general non-technical audience across the entire company to more and more technical

181
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:45.319
Evan Simeone: content tracks for our product and engineering teams. we recently had a hackathon that was AI themed

182
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:55.099
Evan Simeone: and had dozens. Well, yeah, about 2 dozen, I would say projects. I was the most

183
00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:00.380
Evan Simeone: engaged hackathon project or event that we've ever had

184
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.770
Evan Simeone: lots and lots of really interesting ideas that come out of that.

185
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:12.999
Evan Simeone: we're exploring, you know legal ramifications for our creators and for the industry in general, and the, you know, the the topic of

186
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.410
Evan Simeone: our

187
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:25.679
Evan Simeone: our content creators content being used to train AI is something that we're looking at very closely. it clearly has been. We have a lot of food creators,

188
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.890
Evan Simeone: recipe sites and things like that.

189
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:38.279
Evan Simeone: and it seems like many, if not all, have been used to to train Gpt open AI, G, we 2, 3, 3 and a half, 4

190
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.060
Evan Simeone: to the point where, like, you can get very specific

191
00:53:43.420 --> 00:54:00.610
Evan Simeone: impersonations of individual creators, and with details of their background and stuff that it already knows. So that's something from a legal policy perspective that we're we're looking at as well. I could go on and on, but I won't. That's my my quick overview, I guess.

192
00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:08.720
Town Hall: Hey, Evan, can you talk about the business model of raptive just for sex with people realize it's not just you as a publisher. But you as a

193
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:15.099
Evan Simeone: yeah. Yeah. So we represent individual

194
00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:31.039
Evan Simeone: small medium-size publisher. So many of them are. you know. bloggers, food bloggers, for example, or travel. entertainment finance. You know, there are a number of different verticals. We also have an enterprise.

195
00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:36.839
Evan Simeone:  offering, for you know more traditional publishers.

196
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:49.719
Evan Simeone: and we offer them a number of services, primarily, you know. And and the background is providing the add technology. So the ideas. We offer an add technology stack, that's.

197
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.969
Evan Simeone: you know, comparable to any of the big publishers in the world. But we make it available

198
00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:00.100
Evan Simeone: to small independent publishers, and they don't really have to do anything.

199
00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.080
Evan Simeone: and

200
00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:12.920
Evan Simeone: so that's the core of our business. But more and more we've been offering additional services to help them with search, with email, and with affiliate and

201
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:17.710
Evan Simeone: basically anything that they need to be successful with their business.

202
00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:25.069
Town Hall: Thank you. And also, thanks to Matt and Hayes and Evan and Paul for being so honest talking about this stuff.

203
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:37.549
Town Hall: and unlike Mike Duke, and is going to tell us nothing, and just get as much information as he can out of this. But it's really nice when people share, isn't it, to again, it's nice that you take some notes and like, Oh, that's an interesting idea. I think I learned something. Thank you.

204
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:38.830
Town Hall: Okay.

205
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.500
Town Hall: Give you a hard time

206
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.389
Town Hall:  is the deem on the call. Is he on the zoom?

207
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:59.779
Town Hall: No. I guess not. Okay. Because if it's not at his place, he's not going to participate. And someone text them doing. Can you test them.

208
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.330
Dave Johnson?

209
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:07.250
Town Hall: I don't think so. but it's hard to tell. Okay.

210
00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:14.750
Town Hall: next we'll go to time. Brian, are you gonna talk. Paul, give me the microphone, please. Thanks.

211
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:30.200
Town Hall: Hey? Everyone, Brian. I mean, from time. the Svp of data product and engineering. We have Sam Cooney here from edit. We have Jeff Lee here, who is our GM. And we've got Sharon Mills on the phone. She runs our infrastructure and information security.

212
00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.999
Town Hall: I think that's everybody. Kelly's on the phone, too. Kelly's on the phone, too. Kelly's on the

213
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.590
Kelly Conniff: okay, Kelly Kelly. Yes, Hi

214
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:41.200
Town Hall: Kelly is also on the editorial side. Jamie. So you have some rather in here.

215
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:53.179
Town Hall: so we're we're who owns AI at our company. That's a really good one, because there's no one single owner. we are collaborating. Jeff and I are putting together a task force

216
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:59.310
Town Hall: pretty soon to talk through with different parts of the company on how we can

217
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:21.860
Town Hall: accelerate our path to AI. There are some things that I've listed on here that we've done as legacy. AI, right? There's there's Nlp tagging propensity modeling AI right content recommendations. That's all kind of the the legacy AI stuff that we've been doing for a year now. But when it comes to Jen AI used cases. there's

218
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:30.909
Town Hall: there's a lot of talk. What we're trying to do is make sure we're thinking about it from a responsible. AI perspective, right? And and

219
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:39.240
Town Hall: the the biggest. I think all the publishers here kind of feel the same way that our biggest value is trust and and our content.

220
00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.120
Town Hall: and

221
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.490
Town Hall: if we don't put out that content, then

222
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:53.939
Town Hall: Google and open A, I don't actually have a whole lot to use. Right? So we have to figure out that balance. And we're we're thinking about it from both a defensive perspective

223
00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:13.879
Town Hall: and an offensive perspective. So on defense. What can we do in terms of making sure legal is involved. talking to, you know, other publishers, other people in the industry about how we might protect our IP, but also from an offensive perspective. What types of products can we build? we're exploring areas in workflow efficiency?

224
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:32.410
Town Hall: which I think everybody here is right. How do we? How do we work more efficient like? Matt said. It's like having the smartest person in the room that you've ever worked with right next to you. So can we multiply that? Tenx we're also thinking about, how do we build products that will engage consumers better?

225
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:56.420
Town Hall: we're we're experimenting with using a set of our content as the only source for large language model right to, to to be able to build a maybe a quiz off of, or something. we're experimenting with. Get up co-pilot for for engineering. we have a early access to do at for bigquery. so there, there's

226
00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:13.420
Town Hall: AI generative AI kind of sprinkled throughout the company today. kind of pause. Oh, yeah. 1 one other one other area that's that we're definitely exploring. We're on wordpresses. Cms, so one of the opportunities we have is to explore some

227
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:27.190
Town Hall: some open source integrations as plugins for accelerating our editorial team on a yeah, that should have been a question about like, who Cms are you on? So Daily Mail is a proprietary home built? Cms, Paul, do you have a Cms.

228
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:30.310
Okay?

229
00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:38.950
Town Hall: So it's proprietary wordpress, Wordpress. And I think Forbes will come up. They're proprietary also.

230
00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:46.500
Evan Simeone: if many of our publishers or creators do use wordpress. but it's a mix

231
00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:51.499
Town Hall: right? And so one of the one of the benefits to that is, you kind of get the

232
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.150
Town Hall: the, the

233
00:59:53.440 --> 01:00:03.490
Town Hall: the open source community contributing and accelerating the the development of plugins that you can then use pretty rapidly. So we're exploring some of those with Wordpress Vip

234
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:11.269
Town Hall: Jeff Kelly, Sam. I'd like to hear from Kelly on the editorial side, if she is anything to add on this.

235
01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:41.629
Kelly Conniff: Sure, I mean I I think it's tricky for us, right? Because one of the big things we've been really focused on is covering AI from an editorial perspective, right? And and I can tell you, you know, off the record, we're working on a cover that I think will be out either later today or early tomorrow. That'll be on this exact topic and kind of what's happening in the news. So some of what we're doing in the newsroom is that actual coverage. And I think what we're also trying to do, and and Burhan and Jeff, and and every kind of on the the product and digital side has been helpful. Here is figuring out how to work with

236
01:00:41.630 --> 01:01:05.240
Kelly Conniff: the journalists in our newsroom to make them feel comfortable with this technology, which is really tricky, right? Because there are some you know, folks have their backs up against the wall, understandably about how to make sure. You know, this technology is not replacing them, or, you know, making them not feel like their their contributions are valuable. So I think we're gonna start to do some testing about, how can we use AI to to kind of

237
01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:23.670
Kelly Conniff: tweak or workflows, as as Brian is saying. You know, as an example, can we have? we use things like chat, gpt, and barred to start writing some summaries and tweets and and other kind of types of copy for us that we, of course, you know, are going to fact, check and and look at before we go live, but start to kind of integrate it into our workflow there.

238
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.729
Town Hall: anyone else? From time or we can move on.

239
01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.030
Town Hall: we'll move on

240
01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:43.720
Town Hall: accu weather. I think, Steve, mommy is not on the call. I think he is with his kids on Field Day. I'm here. I got a break. I missed you.

241
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:53.229
Town Hall: Oh, and it's also you invited Oliver. So, Steve, do you want to give a little intro, and then into Oliver?

242
01:01:53.370 --> 01:02:01.500
Steve Mummey: But hey, everyone I'm Steve and I do mostly programmatic and data at you weather. And then Oliver is our chief operating officer who

243
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:14.850
Steve Mummey: really is leading up most of what we're doing, although, as you can see, who owns AI in our company, it is a hodgepodge. We're still trying to figure it out, because there's a lot of different paths and and opportunities.

244
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:23.450
Steve Mummey: you know we're not we. We're in the talking phase, and I think experimenting probably, like many here, you know, I think we're a little different in that.

245
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:37.000
Steve Mummey: We're very local, right? So most of what we're going to be doing is at the local level at scale. So covering, you know, all, obviously, us cities and towns, and then global for footprint we have.

246
01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:44.779
Steve Mummey: And then most of that work is in the science area, right? It's in the actual forecast modeling. It's in the weather itself, and how we're using AI to just

247
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:47.260
make a better weather forecast. Honestly.

248
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:56.589
Steve Mummey: and then, obviously, we have some, you know, operational efficiencies. We're looking at, you know, newsletter creation again. More, not again. Not personal, but local.

249
01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:09.959
Steve Mummey: con taxonomy creation. I know from at least a programmatic standpoint we're all looking at. How do we better inform what the new I think generation of Dsp is? Gonna look like. And it's getting the the correct data signals and as much

250
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:20.890
Steve Mummey: as much information as we can to the Dsp without. Obviously cannibalizing what our core direct business would be doing so again, automating a lot of those processes and workflows.

251
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:26.780
Steve Mummey: and then just enhancing just the forecast language itself. You know we have.

252
01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:44.979
Steve Mummey: I like old AI. I like that term from before you know a system that kicks out a word at forecast. For you know, 3 billion locations or whatever worldwide. And this is really, how do we enhance that? How do we bring in more? You know, local terminology get more culture into some of the phrasing and whatnot. So that's

253
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.319
Steve Mummey: again, how we're a little different, I think, than most of the

254
01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:53.239
Steve Mummey: create. Once for many models versus. We're more of a a personal one to one

255
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:58.979
Steve Mummey: content engine. So again, most mostly talking not a lot of action. But

256
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.900
Steve Mummey: and and again, the focus is on this more the science than creation of content.

257
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:10.719
Town Hall: Okay, thank you very much. The Dean. We're gonna do one more and then go back to you so you can see the format.

258
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:16.959
Town Hall: next we have Fox. We have Samir and Oliver

259
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:19.670
Town Hall: Oliver here, go ahead.

260
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.889
Town Hall: everyone over some years over there.

261
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:29.559
Town Hall: I'm the rep of analytics and strategy data strategy at so

262
01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:48.459
Town Hall: about a year in I, I, an issue is a primarily around content creation on the video side. So it's content recommendation. Then it'll be tagging propensity modeling like we're on set the legacy stuff. But we've also spent a lot of time with close captioning highlight generation. I don't know if you all were familiar with

263
01:04:48.930 --> 01:05:06.000
Town Hall: for the World Cup, or we had this feature which we launched, which was the catch up real. So if you join anytime in the game you would get a 1 min clip of the highlights so like things like that were through AI a lot of the stats that the commentators talk about is coming through our AI system, too.

264
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:14.690
Town Hall: as of now, AI, I think data seems like to be the leader. Maybe a bias over there, but it is

265
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:20.710
Town Hall: to someone else in daily nails that it is a CEO objective initiative that we're looking at.

266
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:24.050
Town Hall: I know somebody. Do you want to add anything else from any? I point a few.

267
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.980
Town Hall: Yeah.

268
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.410
You need that

269
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:49.670
Town Hall: either air powered campaigns, or something that we've been trying to dabble through an experiment with and run some Pocs with. So I think, other than that, I think sports is where we've been actually be able to run something production level and be able to create some condensed highlights or be able to create some analytics.

270
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:54.090
Town Hall: almost real time within the game which is really cool to see.

271
01:05:54.460 --> 01:06:18.210
Town Hall: I did want to point about another thing, which is from a data operations. One of you, we think of AI right into a reporting and analytic strategy, which is, can we get curated data in a catalogue and have you on top of it, where you're actually really interacting with with a bonus and getting these answers versus these dashboards and reports. So we partner with Atlin, which seems to be moving

272
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:23.020
Town Hall: pretty aggressive on that side of things. So. Atlin. yeah.

273
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.449
Town Hall: I'm going to jump to the.

274
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:43.530
Town Hall: And I think when you can solve this, he said, oh, yeah, that was a shit that I was doing 5 years ago. That's messed up.

275
01:06:46.040 --> 01:07:06.820
Town Hall:  well, so most of we've had a it data science team for for years. Now, right? Most of the AI that we focused on was on data on our data platform. So creating look like all the audiences propensity modeling for subscriptions for newsletter sign up to registrations.

276
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:23.579
Town Hall: anomaly, detection. content. Texan, I mean trying to, you know, like detect what our content is about using ib categories and multi label and sent them and things like that. So we've created this, actually our first pretty data platform in house.

277
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:41.840
Town Hall: And most of it is based on our data science team building these models. Right? They're very specifically tailored for what we need. It's behavioral target. And it's a demographic target. And so creating kind of a different segments and audiences that has been our main focus for the data science team.

278
01:07:41.840 --> 01:08:10.839
Town Hall: there's also part of like you, said Cm, as optimizations like headline optimization at CEO products and things like that. But I think there is a big difference now, because now we are talking about not AI that we've been used to. Now it's large language models, right? So how do you use those? And that's a different story. So I mean, there are a lot of possibilities here. what we are doing. We mostly experiment. And we we use in Google's vortex AI

279
01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:28.749
Town Hall: platform and their pump to a large language model to kind of play around with 2 types of products. One is internal tools. So how can we improve productivity internally and to external tools. So how can we engage users using these tools? So

280
01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:57.529
Town Hall: the way it works usually is, basically it's their model. But they give you the top layer, and you can train it yourself and find tune it. You load all your content, all your data that you want it secure. It's it's private. And then you kind of ask it and build products on top of it. So that's kind of what we're working on. And then speaking to vendors as well to see if they can kind of accelerate some of those products for us. But it's a lot of experimentation, any any any interesting vendors you're talking to?

281
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:17.039
Town Hall: I'm not gonna tell you. No, yeah. Like somebody, Miso, I'm sure you probably recently heard of them. Maybe they're doing like kind of search replacement on your site with Jen AI, or they're a couple of others didn't do like e-commerce chat bots and things like that. So

282
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:46.880
Town Hall: some conversations. But it's also really easy to do it with. Now, these models that Google and Microsoft to make it available, you basically load your data. It's already trained. You can find tune it, but it's relatively straightforward to experiment with those. so just to be clear, you've loaded the Forbes data into your own. Llm, and you're using that. So yeah, that's what we're trying to do. Yes, trying trying to do right. We we'll load in is easy. But we're trying to figure out like,

283
01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:51.790
Town Hall: what? What data makes sense and things like that. But it's private. So it's secure.

284
01:09:51.819 --> 01:10:02.609
Town Hall: Google makes it very easy to use. It's it's on top of their AI platform that we've been using for years. But yes, that's the that's the have any other publishers done that.

285
01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.460
Town Hall: Yeah, okay, never mind. Yeah, we've done a bunch of that.

286
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:25.620
Town Hall: Okay. But our focus. Still, our money is coming from our data platform. And all the I that we do it there. So all the model and propensity for subscriptions. you know. segments for advertising. That's our bread and bother. So far this is experimental.

287
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.140
Town Hall: Thank you.

288
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:38.300
Town Hall: next is Comcast, Mr. Larry Allen. Hold on, Larry. Now, Larry, you work for a big as company.

289
01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.999
Town Hall: Yeah. Hi, comcast advertising.

290
01:10:42.030 --> 01:11:09.100
Town Hall: yeah, we are a big company. So we do a lot in AI, and I'm not really aware of everything that we do. But one of the big ones is content. Ingest. So all the video that we take in from all of our programming partners, runs through the computer vision engine that we then assign a bunch of metadata kind of second by second. we also evaluate all of the close captioning that comes with the that video content.

291
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:17.909
Town Hall: We then generate a bunch of metadata on the video content itself as well as all the advertising that comes through, and we use that to then inform

292
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:40.389
Town Hall: recommendation models for the guide, for the responses of the voice, remote And then on the advertising side, we we're converting all of that metadata to contextual signals that we're now experimenting with Nbc, where we basically pass that those signals in add requests. so there's kind of some unification happening between

293
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:46.220
Town Hall: the ingest, the video player that sits in the device. And then the add

294
01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:52.540
Town Hall: system. and so that's a that's a big, big body of work that we're doing.

295
01:11:52.760 --> 01:12:08.920
Town Hall: The other piece is from a quality is assurance perspective within free wheel. they're running AI on the advertising that they ingest for delivery, and a lot of that is around ensuring understanding of duplicate

296
01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:22.930
Town Hall: content. in order to reduce hosting fees and increase. You know, speed delivery all that stuff. So there's a bunch of quality assurance that that work that's being done inside of free will and then on the kind of

297
01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:52.889
Town Hall: consumer side. We basically are using AI to, you know, communicate with customers right? So when they call into the tech center, we have a bunch of AI that's kind of constantly learning. And we're changing responses in order to improve service. and then in inside of the Xfinity marketing group. we have this capability. We call next Beck's next best action. and we basically across the entire consumer pro footprint, subscriber footprint.

298
01:12:53.020 --> 01:13:04.950
Town Hall: We understand kind of behaviors, products, services that each of those customers are subscribed to, and depending on engagement with the system. we make

299
01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:33.279
Town Hall: kind of recommendations on the next promotion to offer to individual subscribers to household and so we use that through email communication addressable insertion. You know, digital communications through our kind of agency relationships, where we're buying social media, etc. But we're basically making product and upgrade service recommendations to consumers based on kind of existing actions or services that they've got.

300
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:35.489
Town Hall: So, yeah, that's yeah.

301
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:52.960
Town Hall: But you're not really involved with any of the content creation, not no, because we take content from other content creators and distribute it. That's like our made thing. And look, Nbc. Is probably doing a whole bunch of stuff from a content creation standpoint. But I'm not privy to that. What do you think of Linda Yakarino going to Twitter?

302
01:13:53.440 --> 01:14:07.549
Town Hall: I think it was a great move for her, although she's gonna be in for a world to hurt. It's not going to be easy. What do you give her? 12 months? No, she's a survivor. She's a survivor. You ever 1818,

303
01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:13.230
Town Hall: just on the video, is anybody doing the article creating videos from articles?

304
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:30.780
Town Hall: We already do that with, Exco right? A a Exco already does that sort of automated for us. We're not doing custom ones. But Exco reads in the Api. The content of the page and make slide shows sort of kinetics does the same sort of thing. versus us doing it. This book.

305
01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:35.340
Town Hall: Okay, next, is it? And your craft? I don't know.

306
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.170
Town Hall: No, it's do again.

307
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.059
Town Hall: He's done, that's it.

308
01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:57.070
Town Hall: No comment. Hi, We, we are exploring, and I'll share what we're exploring. it's could go either way. I I kind of combined automation efforts here with

309
01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:59.419
Town Hall: actual AI, and I notice

310
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:13.789
Town Hall: axios is combining them as well in their coverage, and they're like that kind of combining them. old AI, if you will. Right? Yeah, like what the Dean was doing over there. All, it's okay, still works, maybe.

311
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:27.770
Town Hall: but just general things like content translation, like, how are we getting into localization of our English brands? this opportunities? We we're predominantly American brand, what do we? How do we maybe do multilingual.

312
01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:52.859
Town Hall: we're using it to bootstrap service code. it does. Okay. It wouldn't pass a developer's test, but it jump. Starts a lot of What we do. Somebody else mentioned Github our Han. I think you did the Github co-pilot. We are actively using it, and it's it's you know. It's early. It was like a couple of weeks in But it's it's doing pair programming. It's doing type of heads and suggesting things. It's good

313
01:15:53.030 --> 01:16:07.239
Town Hall: we got it for all our engineers. we are actually automating part of our sales operations, pipeline. You're the first person so far to mention. So we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, if you remember, on the rooftop. Yes, I remember.

314
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:31.060
Town Hall: So it's not. It's really gonna be like rough alpha this just this week. But the, this is the part I say automation, because it's literally just taking the plan that the strategists have already put together and putting it it, running it through a knowledge base of, you know, rate cards and availabilities and stuff like that.

315
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:37.129
Town Hall: and then generating spreadsheets. It's nothing, Major, do you get nervous about putting that data into

316
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:45.909
Town Hall: barter Gpt, and then they have access to it. Yeah, we're not doing that. No, it's a closed system. Yeah. So the that that's why I'm careful to call automation

317
01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:53.930
Town Hall: where AI and those type of systems may or may not come in would be in potentially strategizing, like trying to go

318
01:16:54.010 --> 01:17:10.119
Town Hall: be beyond just like the spreadsheet generation aspect of it like, Oh, you want to run these day. It's okay. background on a movie that's being promoted like you could throw kind of the deck together from climb materials. but that this is like just

319
01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:11.569
Town Hall: V one right now.

320
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:33.959
Town Hall:  and then the we're just open to exploring. I don't mean to be coy about it. We just like not not committing to anything. We're just listening, exploring, playing with stuff and who owns it? it's just a general counsel of key people and product tech operations and label.

321
01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.679
Town Hall: And you want to have any probing questions for do again, since he's talking so much.

322
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.090
Town Hall: you have any as legal a letter.

323
01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:56.009
Town Hall: So our legal, I think a few of our legals are involved with the Nma, and the principles that they put out. legal is very comfortable. they're

324
01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:06.859
Town Hall: they're fine with anything we're doing on a back end in terms of code development or sales Ops. But like, obviously, they're interested. And what we're thinking about for content creation. And

325
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.070
Town Hall: you know where where we go. There.

326
01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:14.720
Town Hall: that's pretty much their involvement there. They'd be happy to see us do recipes. But you know that's

327
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:16.000
Town Hall: about it.

328
01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:27.080
Town Hall: Oh, we haven't done anything more than

329
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:31.089
Town Hall: support those principles. Yeah. I don't know if others have.

330
01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:32.340
Yeah.

331
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:40.420
Town Hall: give them the mic. Other people can hear the Diller, Axel spring or news court movement.

332
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.509
that will not

333
01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.550
Town Hall: there. Yeah, just to

334
01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:48.979
Town Hall: And and we we know we've seen proof that

335
01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:56.299
Town Hall: that our content was used in the and the model. Right? So we'll get yeah, that's an era. I think we

336
01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:03.040
Town Hall: again, we should at least talk, if not work together.

337
01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:04.040
Okay.

338
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:23.639
Town Hall: your no, no, no, I'm not gonna respond to it, either. sales apps comment that you made. You're gonna have to give that Mike right back to him. for the sales. Ops. comment that you made you mentioned. it's closed.

339
01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:38.770
Town Hall: What do you mean by that? It's just not using any of the open Lms or any of the open platforms. It's just it's just an internal database and system that we run using a combo of like, you know Google sheets slack bots and a database.

340
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:40.680
Are you

341
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:59.850
Evan Simeone: so sorry to just jump in here? But on this point, and Matt, you had a question about, do you trust putting your data into that? I feel like this is something that's worth talking about, which is like the difference between different approaches to using systems. Self-host systems

342
01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:16.359
Evan Simeone: open AI in the different versions of open AI, or how you can use it. Chat Gbt versus an enterprise license, or using your databases and other stuff like, there's a lot of differences in in sort of what happens to your data when you put it in depending on how you put it or where.

343
01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:18.300
Town Hall: That's what I'm looking at.

344
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:27.960
Town Hall: Yeah, yeah, I think there's a lot of confusion over that I'd love to, because we we've done the thing where we say, Yeah, don't use us. But I have no idea if it's working.

345
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:53.989
Town Hall: So so Google, for example, gives you sandbox that you use yourself. They have no access to your data technically. And it's all yours. Basically, it's not shared. They don't train model on that data. So it's all in your kind of isolated environment. So yeah, and and open AI depending on which thing you're using, there are different terms of service. And it makes it very clear about what they do or don't do or might do

346
01:20:54.330 --> 01:21:17.640
Town Hall: And it makes yeah, it makes a big difference. You don't want to use open one, because they will use your data, they will train the model. So you want that price version. You want something. That's so. There's that old. No, they actually, it actually just announced a change in their policy. depending on how you use the service. They're not using your data to try to model. Look, there's that old as the blast paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.

347
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:24.630
Town Hall: But I already give Google all my Google has all my emails, right? Google has every doc I use. G,

348
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:37.580
Town Hall: right? So at some point for us, we just made the decision. We're just going to trust that Google is not going to steal our data. Because if they do, we're screwed in so many other ways already.

349
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:41.570
Town Hall: Okay, so we'll definitely talk about that

350
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:46.119
Town Hall: later on as a breakout. Okay. Next, we have

351
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:50.650
Town Hall: advanced local Matt. can you get the microphone, please? Thank you.

352
01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:55.160
Town Hall: Can you hear me? Alright?

353
01:21:55.180 --> 01:22:03.349
Town Hall: yes. good morning, everyone. You may not know advanced local before I dive. In events, local is a local

354
01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:18.570
Town Hall: media company, meaning we have properties from New Jersey to Oregon, and we have newspapers as well as digital websites. So nj.com to Oregon, live on the West coast to a L for Alabama, etc.

355
01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:24.889
Town Hall: So but we roll those up. my job, I run product technology and a lot of the programs.

356
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:50.110
Town Hall: we basically run it all centrally for all the local properties. So it's an interesting organization structure Some previous people who worked with us know that. So moving on, we we're we're fortunate that our executive team is really excited about the opportunity. They are making strategic positions, investments.

357
01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:57.269
Town Hall: But like everybody here, it's too early to really say those are exploring the partners to work with

358
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:59.769
Town Hall: and willing to invest.

359
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:09.560
Town Hall: you know, to kind of go back to what you see here. These are just some of the points. I think a lot of people have talked to these. we have worked on niche content.

360
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:25.689
Town Hall: Not true AI generation, but more automated content. you know, that's with like United route robots. we use it for things like real estate. So it's a local company. You can get your hands on a lot of local data.

361
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:41.919
Town Hall: such as real estate listings, and you can turn those into any number of interesting stories and roll ups that are just not worth the time and energy of reporter time. So we go after that and high school sports and other areas where coverage is hard to do.

362
01:23:42.300 --> 01:24:03.869
Town Hall: like many people here pretty heavily invested in that strategies. So I won't talk too much about those. But we do tagging people talked about different targeting. We do targeting 2 different ways with Ml. Models, we do one at the content analysis level. So what types of articles should be blocked.

363
01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:07.480
Town Hall: based on machine learning as well as users?

364
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.239
Town Hall: modeling what type of users should be targeted for pay walls. So

365
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:18.139
Town Hall: 2 types of overlaying models to optimize subscriptions all at the end of the day.

366
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:23.889
Town Hall:  think about going forward. We're definitely thinking about

367
01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.190
Town Hall: more innovation and products that we can create.

368
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:34.589
Town Hall: you know, we have local reporters. And so we they don't have a lot of resources at the local level.

369
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.349
Town Hall: So how do we really give them new tools?

370
01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:46.870
Town Hall: you know, we do create videos only on a limited basis due to kind of typical constraints. So we're looking at really how we can take

371
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:59.360
Town Hall: gener of AI into to to new forms of products like mentioned here, audio summaries, so not reading the article. But how can we take one or more articles

372
01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:04.369
Town Hall: and turn them into summaries that we can create as a new product that's really different.

373
01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:17.600
Town Hall: And just video shorts that again, we couldn't do at scale. So I think we're talking about different automations. So those types of efforts are under way, but doing it with actual Jennai AI engines. At this point.

374
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.269
Town Hall:  but just also mentioned on the tech side.

375
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:31.739
Town Hall: we are absolutely experimenting with kind of the efficiency levels. you know, copilot and other tools are in our tech group.

376
01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:38.320
Town Hall: I don't know what other people are finding, but we are. There's a pretty big debate, and we haven't created a policy about it.

377
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.339
Town Hall: some developers are

378
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:51.549
Town Hall: very strictly not interested and will not touch the technology and others, you know, really, obviously as an advantage to drive efficiencies.

379
01:25:51.740 --> 01:26:02.779
Town Hall: efficiency is a big word. I think everybody talked about it same thing on the editorial side. You know. How can we help with optimizing headlines and all the rest of those things?

380
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:17.920
Town Hall: But I tie those more into like the Cms level of efficiency. So I think a mix like everybody said so far that we're working on. Thank you very much. Next is future Eric Harris right next to you. There, Matt.

381
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:36.970
Town Hall: Hi, there! Eric Harris, in the future have been there about a month. How long have you been here? What's that? One month? One month, one month, and coo. So I'm not actually that involving a lot of. So there is a bunch of experimentation. I'm mostly interested in what sort of the conversations we've been having most recently around. The

382
01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:49.279
Town Hall: excuse me, the dealer stuff and sort of what we can do, I do think is the big threat. I'm hoping that 30 to 50% of every ring content isn't a real number. Obviously, I think some of the other bones. It's it's it's 60 to 70,

383
01:26:49.610 --> 01:27:07.730
Town Hall: we'll see. But I mean, it depends on sort of what Google does there, what they're allowed to do there, I think. But we'll say about that and then operational efficiencies are obviously a big big focus for me. And how we can do that throughout the company. So definitely interested in how you know I I wrote here. The CTO owns this.

384
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:23.809
Town Hall: He's very actively involved in a lot of initiatives, but I do think you know these idea of councils. And how do you sort of get buy in? And our people worried about it is really important. you know, I definitely think there's a lot of people to worry about their jobs. I think developers should embrace it. Certainly copilot because it helps them get

385
01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:35.029
Town Hall: the shit worked on, then really work on the more creative and the sort of value add development. So if you have a good developers, I think they should embrace that. But I'm interested in in, if that's the wrong

386
01:27:35.290 --> 01:28:01.930
Town Hall: opinion. But yes, we're doing a lot of stuff. Not just that. That's just the only thing that I sort of knew because we did it. We had announced it. but there's a lot of sort of initiatives going on around a lot of the stuff that we talked about around content. We have our own Cms, we have a lot of our own internal systems. So there's definitely opportunity there. but right now, I'm really focused on sort of the, you know, the bigger sort of I guess. Threat to sort of what we talked about beginning here from a business perspective.

387
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:28.710
Town Hall: And I'm an add, ups Guy. So I know Matt from 25 years ago. And it's good, you know, it's good to be here in sort of a different mindset, I think. Nice to be here. And what was the editorial chop at top at Chat Pod? You guys know it's just something that we just launched as part of the earnings that Shawn wanted to sort of show that we are doing something around AI, really. Oh, one of those. Okay is that it worked. It was cool. But you know, I think you know, the bigger thing is really what's coming in

388
01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:44.129
Town Hall: definitely interested in that conversation we'll get to it. Okay, next, we have daily beast, Lauren. Nice to meet you, Lauren. We've not met in person.

389
01:28:44.210 --> 01:29:05.810
Town Hall: Katie Pillage is our head of revops usually joins here, which is, I am her replacement. I I think we're maybe unique in the group that we're very small company. We're only about 100 people. So there's a lot of exploration we're doing about efficiencies. But we're kind of in that difficult spot of the work to get to the efficiency with

390
01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:16.469
Town Hall: our 5 to 6 engineers is a lot of investment to make before it's certain. So, trying to figure out what plumbing we want to invest in whether it's we have a custom. Cms.

391
01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:20.260
Town Hall: we're evaluating the future. Of

392
01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:36.219
Town Hall: what do we? What should we do now to make sure that as they accelerate. We're present and have an understanding of. But how do we not spin our wheels when we just have

393
01:29:37.530 --> 01:30:01.799
Town Hall: But there are also things we've just tabled because we just don't have bandwidth within our newsroom to do great something as simple as like great descriptions. all text for all of our images where this could solve some things that we've kind of just been living with being mediocre to bad. so I think that's probably the first place where we'll start, where it's sort of just

394
01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:05.370
Town Hall: fallow ground.

395
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:20.019
Town Hall: and then go from there a lot of things we do. Our task forces. Most of our teams are only like one or 2 people. We have, like 2 product managers, 2 subscription people, 2 people. So like all things, we work all of these things through task forces.

396
01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:27.990
Town Hall: which I'll lead with Katie and our head of engineering, and then we'll bring people in through that. But excited to hear

397
01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:34.350
Town Hall: like on the platform side, which is sort of where a lot of people in this room are running sort of the larger

398
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.160
Town Hall: platforms for multiple sites.

399
01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:49.060
Town Hall: I almost see us as like the consumer of that in a lot of ways where, if we were part of a larger, probably be doing that, so to be here also we're owned by.

400
01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:52.120
Town Hall: So as everyone's referenced.

401
01:30:52.210 --> 01:31:18.139
Town Hall: So what is Diller really said? And what's he really talking about? Or he said it's he had something he said, like a month ago, and then you've heard nothing. Yeah, I I think internally, it's just sort of, I see operates largely as a holding company. So all the businesses operate very independently. so like Dod Meredith is owned by. I see we sort of share knowledge at times. So that's the extent of how we work with them. But I think it's just trying to get like

402
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:24.449
Town Hall: on that level task forces across the businesses to understand, like what the opportunities are and try to accelerate focus.

403
01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.850
Town Hall: Thank you very much.

404
01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:34.250
Susan Parker: Next star is Susan Parker on the phone?

405
01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:53.370
Susan Parker:  so I think you know, we've been very much an exploratory mode. outside of outside of some advertising things we've been doing for a long time. We have long had our own sort of data science team with some proprietary modeling. that we do.

406
01:31:53.370 --> 01:32:10.040
Susan Parker: what you know, optimization outcomes for advertisers. And that's all we've been doing for quite some time. We are working now, however, I'm looking at modernizing our content categorization. we've been testing chat. Gbt, as an alternative to Google. Nlp, we're finding it's actually pretty good.

407
01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:23.840
Susan Parker:  we are also you know, in analytics, anomaly detection. I'm looking at some platforms to do a little bit more automation of insights to make it easier for our end users. It is still very exploratory there.

408
01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:41.269
Susan Parker: Some of the other areas, I think are around sales and operations processes. We are looking to do some things like account record clean ups using some AI models to automate what is otherwise a very, very time consuming process. You know. We're we're still again very exploratory.

409
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:58.530
Susan Parker:  I think over time. We're also looking to see how we could use it for you know, sales and campaign planning for you know, identifying based on advertiser. you know, spend level advertiser category. What a media mix may be most effective, based on, you know, previous.

410
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:21.239
Susan Parker: you know, campaign performance and other data. and you know. But bringing that together in a much more automated way. So these are all the types of things we're generally exploring right now, it's really concentrated within tech data product kind of all under our CTO, I I editorial, isn't it? Huge area focuses. You are largely local news content creation. You know, that still requires reporters. And

411
01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:32.699
Susan Parker: you know I headline, optimization isn't something we've historically been great at. I'd love to see us experiment a little bit more there. But we we're not. We're just not there right now. So really, still, kind of a, you know

412
01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:36.890
Susan Parker: data. And you know, operations and advertising focus for us.

413
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:40.539
Town Hall: Thank you.

414
01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:46.760
Town Hall: Pensky Brett, you're on the phone as Zoom. Is anyone else there, or just you?

415
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:58.660
Brett Goverman: It's just me. I couldn't get anybody to wake up this early on the West coast. I you know it's it's it's hard to get people to wake up these days. But

416
01:33:59.150 --> 01:34:24.970
Brett Goverman: quick intro by government associate Vice President of Day strategy at Pmc. I think you know, there's not much that's unique to what we're doing. I think a lot of it is sort of the old AI you know, some some contextual tagging, targeting nlp, stuff. the content generation and speaking with some of our editorial folks they've started to do for like social posts, those sort of quick

417
01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:45.150
Brett Goverman: quick, short content that goes on social. But it's not something that's built into our our processes just yet. you know, some audience modeling stuff like that. I think, where I'm focusing a lot on AI moving forward outside of the, you know, sort of legal stuff is sort of updated Nlp type tagging.

418
01:34:45.420 --> 01:35:14.250
Brett Goverman: I think there's a a major opportunity there to to revamp what we have today. I mean, today, we use pretty much advantage. And and Watson to do a lot of our tagging. And you know the taxonomies are fine, and they get the job done. But I think from what I've seen some, you know, AI can do a lot with that categorization and make it a little bit, maybe more conversational or colloquial. and you know, I think a lot of the Rfps we get don't necessarily match up with an Ibm wants and taxonomy. And so I think

419
01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:31.689
Brett Goverman: there's a world where I could, you know, we could merge those 2 together. And so that's kind of where I've been spending a lot of my time trying to figure out how those 2 technologies meet. haven't necessarily figured out the idea. But definitely something where I'd like to see some innovation on our side.

420
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:34.229
Town Hall: What's thems does Pensky use?

421
01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:35.890
Brett Goverman: Wordpress?

422
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.880
Town Hall: Okay?

423
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:44.099
Brett Goverman: And then who owns it is just everybody. It's it's pretty much a small group of people between product content. Now.

424
01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:55.510
Town Hall: next, we have Condane Nas Milney, who wins the award for the best way of getting to this event. You want to tell the story. Go ahead.

425
01:35:55.740 --> 01:36:18.360
Town Hall: Sure. I think this is maybe a note about Eric, but also who invited me, but also maybe a note about Linkedin becoming the best net like social network. Right now. Surprisingly so I'm Millie Trend. I'm Vp of content strategy and growth economy. Nas and I have Kira, Marco and Tim on Zoom with me.

426
01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:27.500
Town Hall: Kara's on our corporate strategy team. Marco is on our product team team and Tim's on our data science team, and I,

427
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:44.860
Town Hall: I'll I'll skip to the bottom first, which is who owns AI at our company. It's a cross functional working group made of content editorial, obviously product tech data and also legal and strategy. as well as I. I guess you could put in partnerships in there, too.

428
01:36:44.890 --> 01:36:53.269
Town Hall: and then on AI initiatives. Today, I really focused on generative AI initiatives versus calling it old AI so sad.

429
01:36:53.270 --> 01:37:15.209
Town Hall: so in terms of generative AI initiatives. we're I, I I'm a part of the content org. So my goal with this is really to give agency to our editorial teams and have them own their workloads. Because who better to know? Kind of how to optimize and change their workless and

430
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:18.800
Town Hall: people doing it every day. So we're kind of thinking it through

431
01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:44.370
Town Hall: kind of all the phases of the content workflow from planning and research to the actual creation. I think, Matt, you mentioned translation? we. We do have a lot of global editions. And I run our translation out of team adaptation team. We currently use deep L, which is integrated into our Cms. But we're looking at how to incorporate kind of

432
01:37:44.520 --> 01:38:13.459
Town Hall: the newer models to it, because it's kind of better colloquially. And we've seen that it adapts better than just translating So everything from content, creation, translation, adaptation. We have our copy editing and research team even trying to figure out kind of the capabilities in terms of fact, checking which is probably the hardest one. And they're exploring. And I think a really important kind of theme and kind of culture. Change is

433
01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:39.349
Town Hall: to really understand the capabilities, to understand the limitations. and where exactly we can push and where there are major deficiencies like Chat Gpt can do math, for example. so I think, content integrity publishing promotion. production kind of there's so many workflows in every stage of that especially when you kind of think cross format. So

434
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:54.270
Town Hall: there's obviously text texts. But text to video text, to audio text to visuals. and then, obviously, all the data pieces. And I just talking about how dashboards like the idea of dashboards, are starting to feel very

435
01:38:54.420 --> 01:39:07.130
Town Hall: and tick like antiquated to me. And how can we kind of jump straight to analysis? so we're thinking a lot about that. We're thinking about how to incorporate any of these learning into the Cms integrations. And

436
01:39:07.130 --> 01:39:30.029
Town Hall: obviously, I think the another way to think about is is kind of our internal audiences. Our audience of advertisers. And then, obviously our, it's external facing audience. So how can we continue to make our product better? for our users? And I don't know if Kara or Marco or Tim when I do quick introductions or add anything else to that on zoom.

437
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:42.679
Marco Vigano': Yeah, thank you, Billy. I cannot. A couple of experiment that you are running, for example. we are testing the segmentation. If you model from Meta to make images, some limitation.

438
01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:46.539
Marco Vigano': I understand that what is inside that the pixel level in images.

439
01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.810
Marco Vigano': Also, we, we did some test using in video nerve for using photogrammetry

440
01:39:51.900 --> 01:40:18.199
Marco Vigano': and on production, we have some different yeah solution for making the captioning for our videos, particularly for beyond demand, but also for live streaming. For example, we use it for the first time in AI caption before the the Spanish market, and also we are testing some solution for narrow the narrative audio in terms of transforming the audio transforming text to audio and podcast

441
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:21.409
Marco Vigano': do you want to put something on your side?

442
01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:32.280
Tim Shokair: Yeah, I think the couple of things that we're we're looking at from my team's standpoint. really is like how we can leverage open source things. One of the

443
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:49.600
Tim Shokair: things that we've done for what we're calling legacy. AI is fine-tuning, and ll to be able to aid in our classical tasks like contact classification recommendation. and then, yeah, for use in propensity scoring as well.

444
01:40:49.600 --> 01:41:04.750
Tim Shokair: but we're also looking at in, in addition to to kind of to to search product enhancements using using these Lms. How we can leverage some of them to to have a a fine tune. Chat chat service.

445
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:08.470
Tim Shokair: like everybody else.

446
01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.209
Town Hall: Thank you very much. What a Cms.

447
01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.800
Town Hall: We have our own.

448
01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:17.249
What do you use for tech.

449
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.349
Town Hall: Tim? What do we use for tagging

450
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:26.979
Tim Shokair: The stuff that we're working on now is is our is our own.

451
01:41:27.690 --> 01:41:38.699
Tim Shokair: well, for for automated tagging. Yeah. so what we are using now, our custom models that are that are trained, that.

452
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:41.920
Tim Shokair: but leveraging the the.

453
01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:59.209
Town Hall: It's kind of similar to Bloomberg. Launching their kind of internal Lm. Which was trained on, is using an open source model, but trained on kind of basically have fine of their financial data and kind of half public data set

454
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:05.360
Town Hall: next, pass the mic behind you to Mr. Andrew Craft. Go ahead, Andrew. Hi.

455
01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:17.330
Town Hall: First. I just want to say thank you like I've learned more in the past hour of hearing what other people are doing. Thank you so much. And thank you. MSG. And rich, and Paul and everyone super great. So

456
01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:33.929
Town Hall:  In the beginning we screwed up a few times we we had really great ideas of content we'd create and and and sort of aggregation content. And we'd put them out. And then Futurism would write a take down piece of us

457
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:55.230
Town Hall: right like there's a lot of publish a lot of publications we're writing. Take down pieces on the the early efforts of of AI, and it didn't really come to a head like we didn't know what we were going to do until Ben Trot, our chief product officer who was on the phone at an executive off site shared with us. Chat P. We T.

458
01:42:55.470 --> 01:43:03.829
Town Hall: So chat P. Wet was something he built in an hour a chat bot trained on the voice of P. We, Herman, for his kid

459
01:43:03.930 --> 01:43:10.349
Town Hall: right literally. If you typed in, you're a moron, it would respond. I know you are. But what am I

460
01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:25.319
Town Hall: okay for those of you who don't know what to P. We hermit is. You should look that up. but it. It kicked off this process where we we we created a leadership team of B. I. sorry of of product which Ben

461
01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:49.509
Town Hall: leads. Editorial. Rob Barrett, our president of media next to me and I, Co operations. And we decide the roadmap with an advisory group, cross functionally, bi engineering site, etc. We didn't put legal. So I I I know that Geo put legal on theirs. We didn't. We didn't put legal on ours because we're gonna ask for forgiveness instead of permission, and we have some basic guard guardrails will

462
01:43:49.510 --> 01:44:08.500
Town Hall: will operate in You know, Kelly at at at time, I think, said that people were worried about being replaced at some point Shelly Palmer said it really well, at the Luma Conference. we're not gonna be replaced by AI. We're gonna be replaced by people who know how to use AI.

463
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:33.780
Town Hall: And so we take that really seriously, we're we're looking at ways like, I've got the Hr. Department looking at training for how to use AI and your everyday work for people. We already have people going out and connecting their own AI systems, which we have to quickly shut down as it tries to multi-level marketing style, infiltrate everybody in the company. But we we are supporting that and we're working with vendors

464
01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:54.079
Town Hall: to jump. Start. So, Jasper noaa we use jiffy. AI. As for for to help with productivity. actually saw this really interesting one started by Omar Tukawal, who founded blue Kai called Rembrandt, which is AI based product placement

465
01:44:54.080 --> 01:45:14.240
Town Hall: in in videos. So we're looking into all of those. we see the initiatives really having 3 tracks, efficiency, efficacy, and content. And our goal is every 2 weeks sprint to roll out something else to in each of those 3 tracks, so to ideate scope.

466
01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:41.279
Town Hall: come out with something quickly evaluate and iterate rather than saying, Let's do this big thing that takes 12 sprints. Let's do one sprint projects and then build on them from there, and then, you know, we'll reevaluate over time. So efficiency our ways to make our team faster. And we, unlike some of the companies here, we've actually focused on editorial rather than focusing on productivity outside, although we have some elements there as well. So story starters, style

467
01:45:41.280 --> 01:46:07.500
Town Hall: guide edits, etc., efficacy ways to make our teams better at what they do title suggestions feed analysis for what's the best thing to write on right now, that's going to capture an audience. And the content we're looking to build is AI specific. We have the Si vault. What like literally every story ever written in Si incredible volt of 59 years of content

468
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:14.009
Town Hall: that is incredibly hard to find the story you want in it, but with an AI concierge

469
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:27.639
Town Hall: you can say, Hey, I'd like to learn all about Joe Brown and get everything ever written on Joe Brown, and that's the sort of thing chat bots. Also looking at AI powered ads that's on the content side. But we are not.

470
01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:53.879
Town Hall: We are not looking to write articles with AI. We believe that AI doesn't as much as I can get it to sound like Varducci writing on baseball. It doesn't have the breath and the nuance that a human created piece does. We can help them get help. Those humans get started. But we are staying far away because we think it's not a good use of the technology to create content directly

471
01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:10.249
Town Hall: interesting conversation we could have later. I think we have like one or 2 more. So news, Corp. So David, who I just met in the back, was invited by Paul Bannister. Nice to meet you, David.

472
01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:22.950
Town Hall: go ahead, and there's other just full disclosure. There's Jamie and Keith over there who are at the Wall Street Journal team on, you know them. but I just make sure everybody knows everybody. Go ahead.

473
01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.269
I think it's one

474
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:32.029
Town Hall: go. How about now? Yes.

475
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:38.839
Town Hall: okay. So David Rowley, news corps look out for revenue technology at headquarters.

476
01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:49.520
Town Hall: so to disappoint you already, I am not the one who AI in the company. I know enough about it to be, you know, to break some things. But

477
01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:56.600
Town Hall: overall just a way, I think a lot of You have already discussed how your companies are organized.

478
01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:17.810
Town Hall: I work at the headquarters level, which Each one of the business units like Wall Street Journal, New York Post. the Times, the sun out of the Uk. They all usually do their own things. There's no mandates coming from from the top. And so, because of that, a lot of the initiatives and projects around. AI have really come

479
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:32.360
Town Hall: from each one of the business units, I would say, Oh, re! More recently, especially since Jennai has really become the big thing. We have started up this AI alliance which Nicole Castio, who unfortunately cannot attend

480
01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:48.150
Town Hall: This call is is spearheading that. And really what that Alliance is trying to do. It's effectively a working group that is trying to bolster and foster collaboration and sharing across the business units, really trying to

481
01:48:48.380 --> 01:49:12.160
Town Hall: show what ideas are working, what are resonating and trying to bring them and propagate them across across the business. So besides that a lot of the initiatives to date. I can't again really speak to too much, but it's a lot of what you all have been doing this, you know, particularly around content creation. we've been using AI and Ml for the last couple of years around fact checking

482
01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:25.499
Town Hall: doing related content data is just a journalism. So taking a large swaps of data and being able to turn them into actual usable data, and we and

483
01:49:25.930 --> 01:49:30.679
Town Hall: content for for a journalist to to then

484
01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:47.480
Town Hall: bake it into reality. Also, media intelligence. We have our story full business unit who has done a lot of a lot with AI around trying to discover misinformation, deep fakes, etc. from a social intelligence perspective. a lot

485
01:49:47.480 --> 01:50:02.079
Town Hall: like you've all said around. Content, analysis content aggregation. we used to have a a a company called canoes, which we sold off, which was very much using AI to help aggregate content into

486
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:25.450
Town Hall: into certain pairings of of of of that type of content personalization. A lot. Nothing really here from nothing different that you guys are doing email content, personalizing content specifically for newsletters recommendation widgets, trying to personalize, content to get more engagement out of a user after that, first like second click

487
01:50:25.590 --> 01:50:38.800
Town Hall: and then retention understanding, you know, having a smart paywall, determining propriety, scoring for users to try to show them either. How many articles when to bring up or down the paywall

488
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:43.009
Town Hall: improved engagement of those users, and really also

489
01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:59.060
Town Hall: targeted marketing around, creating doing audience modeling to try to figure out the best creative to put in front of a person the best offer. And, Larry, you mentioned the next best action. That is something that the Uk has been testing over the last couple of years.

490
01:50:59.150 --> 01:51:12.860
Town Hall:  I guess. Last but least sorry. Just one other quick thing.  I think where the way that we see it is that we are.

491
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:37.590
Town Hall: We've been using AI over the last couple of years to optimize current capabilities. And I think where we want to go is to try to create new capabilities, those new, not necessarily bright, shiny objects, but bigger things that we ha! That may are more unknown to this point. I think also going from innovation to industrialization. And this is a lot of what the AI Alliance is hoping to do

492
01:51:37.590 --> 01:52:01.780
Town Hall: in the coming months is to take all of the learnings that each business unit has been doing also looking at their, you know, trying to apply a maturity model and trying to get each business unit up to the same level across the board. last, but not least, we are gonna be doing a hackathon where we are. Gonna be bringing in people around the globe. that'll be happening in late June

493
01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:12.120
and then for me, personally. from a Jedi perspective, I'm super excited about dynamic content up or sorry. Not dial a content dynamic, creative

494
01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:36.189
Town Hall: optimization. And what we're able to do on the marketing side interested in that as well as also being able to take all of the from an advertising perspective. All the log level data, everything that we collect on users and what they do down to the impression level and try to use AI to help inform and move dynamic pricing floors to help with with yield.

495
01:52:36.670 --> 01:52:37.380
Town Hall: So

496
01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:55.639
Town Hall: thank you. Jamie, do you want to add anything? Say who you are. Hi! I'm Jamie Heller. I'm the business editor at the Wall Street Journal, and is my colleague or reporter who covers media and specifically the intersection of Media and AI

497
01:52:55.990 --> 01:53:24.979
Town Hall: in time. Well, I would like to take them a moment to tell you what we are writing about, and so over the course of this morning. You could give us some feedback on that. But this is obviously come on fast and furious, journalistically as well as technically. So we've been trying to organize ourselves. one of the biggest topics we're trying to cover is who's winning the AI race, whether it's Microsoft versus Google versus open AI. And you see in videos hugely capitalizing on this. So who's the winners and losers in business?

498
01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:34.110
Town Hall: there's also the intellectual debates of like is this, gonna you know, destroy humanity, or it's gonna be good for humanity. These are all things we need to be

499
01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:38.189
Town Hall: in the flow on and and thinking about as well,

500
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:55.129
Town Hall: We are writing about the regulatory issues, which I think is a little early now, and not the most interesting subject. But we have to be staying on that and then it's on an industry by industry basis. Publishing is obviously huge.

501
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:59.699
Town Hall: for a lot of reasons, all the data that drives the publishing business. But also

502
01:53:59.730 --> 01:54:00.770
Town Hall: we write.

503
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:15.210
Town Hall: you know, we have to be factual, and that's been a big debate on these things, or how how factual are they as opposed to Hollywood, where we're also covering the intersection of Hollywood and AI, where, like you could have a script, it could say anything. It's not as important that it's

504
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:26.989
Town Hall: it's reliable. so that's a big difference. So we're studying basically AI's impact on many industries and parts of society health care, I think, has a potential to be hugely

505
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.040
Town Hall: benefit

506
01:54:28.170 --> 01:54:35.330
Town Hall: benefits hugely from AI education. It's a lot of pros and cons with AI and education. So

507
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:40.580
Town Hall: and then we also have to be careful of the hype.

508
01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:51.190
Town Hall: and that we don't overplay our hand on this, which doesn't feel like we are, because, even being in a meeting like this. It obviously feels incredibly important and transformative. But

509
01:54:51.460 --> 01:55:01.760
Town Hall: you know, any startup can put AI on its name and then get evaluation, and we have to be. Part of our job is to bring appropriate skepticism to the developments.

510
01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:07.520
Town Hall:  in terms of our newsroom.

511
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:21.970
Town Hall: I don't think I have that much to say. I don't really know how much is going on on this, and I think more needs to be going on. I was at the I. N. A conference last week, and several publications presented

512
01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:33.040
Town Hall: mostly from Europe. They were seemingly much farther advanced than I think we are. in terms of integrating A. I into their newsroom.

513
01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.360
Town Hall: and

514
01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:39.299
Town Hall: then this is only briefly touched on. But the authenticity of

515
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:48.790
Town Hall: imagery, I think, is going to be a huge challenge for our newsrooms and making sure we don't get snowed. That's a whole other topic.

516
01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:53.450
Town Hall: And the last thing I'll just mention

517
01:55:53.830 --> 01:56:04.839
Town Hall: This takes up on a little. But Andrew was saying, it's like we can't have our head on the sand on this and pretend it's not happening in terms of how it's going to affect our workflow in the newsroom, but I I do feel

518
01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:06.550
Town Hall: that

519
01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:27.509
Town Hall: good reporters like walk before they run, and I I do worry of how many steps. AI will enable people to skip, and well reporters be able to be to get as good as teach if they just like. Have all these helpers, you know, all the time. but you can't like stop the force of technology. So

520
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:32.350
Town Hall: no, somehow we'll have to walk that balance as as an industry in the society.

521
01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:43.269
Town Hall: Thank you very much. Okay. Now, lastly. Jay, do you want to say anything? Are you allowed to say anything? You gotta say something

522
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.710
Town Hall: he's gonna talk.

523
01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:52.840
Town Hall: Say who you are, Jay.

524
01:56:53.590 --> 01:56:55.649
Town Hall: we're I mean.

525
01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:01.119
Town Hall: I'm the only empty slide in the entire deck. J. That should speak volumes.

526
01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:09.810
Town Hall: I am a very vocal member, typically and this is really sensitive.

527
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:12.250
Town Hall: and so I'm sure

528
01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:27.660
Town Hall: our partner or not partners. But our competitors in the same news realm has the same concerns. I think there are other leadership groups that are more willing to talk proactively about it. I keep looking at news Corp and Wall Street Journal, speaking about the 2 of you

529
01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:33.420
Town Hall: more specifically. But I think that you know there's a lot that was said thus far in the room that

530
01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:48.359
Town Hall: I'm personally in my could personal capacity very excited about testing and working on But right now we we are just not disclosing where our stance is right quite yet, or I'm at least not available to do that.

531
01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:53.290
Town Hall: So that's what I can say. Rich, is that okay, Paul? Is that okay, you said

532
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:59.990
Town Hall: he came late. Okay.

533
01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:07.799
Town Hall: we're going to do whatever Washington Post does, but better

534
01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:10.949
Town Hall: based on here. But I think the

535
01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:18.709
Town Hall: the way they? There's they've publicized how they've created teams to drive progress. if you haven't seen that, I think it's a good structure.

536
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:30.000
Town Hall: they have a task force that provides governance more strategy. And then they have an operational team. So yeah.

537
01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:36.719
Town Hall: oh, don't say too much. I mean, Jay. Come on, hold back

538
01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:44.400
all right.

539
01:58:45.090 --> 01:58:47.830
Town Hall: That was, as Andrew Craft said, that was frigging awesome.

540
01:58:48.150 --> 01:58:57.580
Town Hall: Okay. So Matt Wheatlin and I yesterday went through every single publisher, besides the ones who added stuff at the last minute.

541
01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:01.250
Town Hall: and

542
01:59:01.290 --> 01:59:07.430
Town Hall: you know, as as we thought would happen, of all the initiatives, almost half were content related.

543
01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:22.160
Town Hall: There's no big surprise here. It's just nice to take all that data and put into a chart. we did try to feed the Google slide deck into barred, and it really did work to try to get a summary. I'll try that again. But it did not work.

544
01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.890
Town Hall: Okay. So

545
01:59:26.490 --> 01:59:33.680
Town Hall: the question is, now, if to everyone. Give their intros. There's probably 4 or 5 topics we need to deep dive into

546
01:59:33.770 --> 01:59:37.580
Town Hall: and I'll let the room figure out what

547
01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:54.329
Town Hall: no breaks, no breaks. If we take a break, then we want to get out of here by Noonish. You need a bathroom. Go over there. There's one there. There's one around the corner. But I think one of the topics and I'll I'll gonna throw it to Paul Bannister is about how the publishers get paid for this.

548
01:59:54.430 --> 02:00:06.240
Town Hall: and the reason I'm throwing it to Paul is, we had a round table 3 months ago. right in February, and Paul brought this up before anyone was really thinking about this, like you were the first person.

549
02:00:06.490 --> 02:00:13.089
Town Hall: and I have a couple of slides, but it's it's it's let. Well, no, that I I do have a good slide here.

550
02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:17.400
Town Hall: This is the data

551
02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:27.219
Town Hall: that a Washington post story talked about about, who is the secret list of making AI smart. So this is basically a list. And I think I

552
02:00:30.330 --> 02:00:41.450
Town Hall: oh, I I I had that as well somewhere. But this was just a really nice list. And I think, Paul, you made a comment, that you added up all your sites, and you are really darn high on this as well.

553
02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:53.340
Town Hall: And you see, you know patents. Wikipedia Scribe, New York Times. Number 4 La times Forbes, Washington Post

554
02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:59.069
Town Hall: business Insider, Daily Mail. Lot of people in this room.

555
02:00:59.130 --> 02:01:04.579
Town Hall: Fox business help to train. So the question is to the room. And I'm gonna give

556
02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:18.900
Town Hall: the mike to you. Paul is like. how do you start this? How do you do that is it the Barry Dealer initiative? My idea was to have Oprah Winfrey figure it out because she's a media person, and she could galvanize us all together. But I'm gonna give it to you, Paul, to just talk about that.

557
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:23.179
Town Hall: I'll talk for a minute. But I feel like other people have done obviously a lot of

558
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:35.449
Town Hall: even, you know, done much more publicly than than we have in in terms of thinking about this and doing things. I think you know Evan mentioned this earlier. We've been talking to legal counsel and a bunch of different areas. And there's a lot of questions around like

559
02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:51.509
Town Hall: how to engage right now, should you engage? Do you go strong and start suing them and start really pushing? Do you start blocking access to your content? You know. Obviously everyone could see. You know how much of the your cons is being used. But I think part of the question which I'm actually saying to, I think is complicated is

560
02:01:51.810 --> 02:02:03.960
Town Hall: what actually is the business model that comes out of this? If you know, if any, is it based on what percent of your content is in the set? Is it based on the queries against the set? And

561
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:12.640
Town Hall: what data fed those queries? Is it based on some kind of usage thing like, what's the actual model here? Because, I think you know, potentially.

562
02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:37.630
Town Hall: whoever gets involved in really negotiating these things could back themselves into a corner, end up choosing the wrong business model that is not actually very feature-proof, and and not make you know the the right choices today, because we we don't know enough yet in terms of what's going on. And honestly, right now, there's not a lot of money to be made here today, but maybe in the future there is. So it's like, what is the right way to approach? This is kind of a big question. So for us, while we've been thinking about it for a while we've sort of not been

563
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:52.630
Town Hall: doing too much a continuing to research, continuing to think about it, continue to try to understand what the models could be, because we're worried that if you go too far down the path you end up, backing yourself into a corner. That's the wrong, the wrong approach, so curious for other thoughts.

564
02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:59.539
Evan Simeone: So let me just add a couple of other thoughts to that which is like, you know, all those concerns about

565
02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:13.300
Evan Simeone: what the model might be, or how you might divide up the money, or you know what kind of terms would make sense. Our you know, like I, it seems to me that before that you know the the basic

566
02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:22.709
Evan Simeone: premise that the creators have any rights over this content at all, as relates to training as the you know, the first obstacle.

567
02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:31.069
Evan Simeone: And then it's like, Okay, and what what kind of terms could you get for it? So you know, I wonder if

568
02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:36.909
Evan Simeone: establishing it as a matter of principle and or

569
02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:47.139
Evan Simeone: you know, legal precedent is the key that it's up to creators or publishers, or you know, IP holders

570
02:03:47.440 --> 02:04:03.500
Evan Simeone: to determine this and that training AI is a form of copying. and therefore needs to be licensed at all. And then then it's a question of like, under what terms and what makes sense and and everything out, or it does the money add up, or

571
02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.820
Evan Simeone: or whatever. But that has not yet happened. and I think it needs to

572
02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:23.489
Town Hall: just one. Another thing to add is like they. There's all these interesting court cases going on like the Andy Warhol case last week, which like nothing to do with AI directly. That is quite relevant because it's about like derivative works on how much

573
02:04:23.610 --> 02:04:41.919
Town Hall: derivation is required to make it. You know who owns which things and things like that. So like, there's these very fuzzy lines that exist right now that are probably going to be drawn more clearly. But it it's gonna come from the courts. If from talking to our lawyers, at least like, because the Regulators aren't going to move fast enough, generally speaking, to really figure this out for anybody else. So

574
02:04:48.750 --> 02:05:03.749
Town Hall: surprise. I have some thoughts. so you know, we see in the press news about Google spending a lot of money on the on the company that employs the well trained, silent man to my right

575
02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:26.639
Town Hall: and licensing content right from from those companies like we hear about that. And then, you know, we, of course, immediately jump on the phone and call of all of our people. And you know they're licensing content that they want to include or not include. And so we thought about, do we just block right, but the reality is only the good actors will listen to a block.

576
02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:54.299
Town Hall: Right? I have robots that we all have robots that txt on our site, the the, the unscrupulous bots don't listen to robots txt they come to our sites, anyway. The unscrupulous AI, you know. Lm, building bots are going to come to our sites, anyway, we can certainly put it behind walls, but that harms harms consumers. And then comes the the, you know, thought of

577
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:57.400
Town Hall: if Google, if I was going to block Google

578
02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:10.849
Town Hall: and say, Look, Google, you can't come to our side anymore and and get smarter. Make your Llm smarter And they go. Okay? Well, then, we just won't refer you traffic. When we give an answer I will fold like a house of cards.

579
02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:37.890
Town Hall: as will. I'm guessing almost everybody in this room, because we are dependent on that traffic. We're all dependent on that traffic other than those who have almost exclusive subscription businesses that might be. Can I ask a question about that last point, though, because the the concern is that they're going to use the Llm. So they don't have to send you traffic. Well, yes, but if the answer is, they'll send us some if they can train on us, but they'll send us 0 if they don't

580
02:06:37.990 --> 02:07:03.849
Town Hall: I? I'm telling you what the the answer is. I don't I? I can't think of a large publisher I will challenge a large publisher in this room or any room to say, Yeah, I can do just fine without any referrals from Google, right? But I guess what my point is that you're then the choice of allowing it right? Because there's a value exchange. It doesn't mean that you would allow anybody to do it, and if there were no value. Exchange.

581
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:28.759
Town Hall: Well, if there's no value exchange but what we're seeing, and I forget who it was you talked about getting in early and and seeing some of the the results is that is that there are still links to content less like for si.com. I might have less, because sports is more of a commodity. But the street.com. I'll have more direct links, because financial information is not a commodity and is not something that

582
02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:39.840
Town Hall: you know y. My L, your money, your life that Google wants to wants to summarize for you, or Bing wants to summarize for you. Who'd ever thought that Bing would be brought up in a sentence again.

583
02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:43.150
Town Hall: that these would want to be summarized right? These are

584
02:07:43.150 --> 02:08:04.489
Town Hall: tool sets that that still need to refer in some way. And so the question is, if it's 0, that's an easy answer. But I don't actually think it'll be 0. I think it'll be less. But there will be plenty of models out there training that aren't going to be search engines and are going to be sending any traffic right. So if you want to cloud Google, that's one thing. But you might not want to allow

585
02:08:04.490 --> 02:08:33.230
Town Hall: others. Well, let me fit. I have no easy way to block them. I can certainly fight the war like we all fight, you know. whether we use human what used to be called White Ops or any of those to stop. You know an Nht. And and and similar. We can certainly fight the war, but we don't. We like. There is still non human traffic that comes to our site, even though we've put in. You know, every block there is. It's a small, small, small amount, but it's still there.

586
02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.210
Town Hall: Matt Jaeger, there's something about a new crawler you know about

587
02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:43.320
Town Hall: I I don't know much. But about a month ago

588
02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:52.500
Town Hall: Google announced that they have a new crawler separated from their existing crawlers. I think it's literally called other bot

589
02:08:52.750 --> 02:09:00.260
Town Hall: So that's the only description. If you look it up, is that it's for R&D purposes.

590
02:09:00.710 --> 02:09:09.590
Town Hall: So you know, lots of speculation what it's tied to, and whether they're trying to separate their proper search pop from how they capture content for other

591
02:09:09.710 --> 02:09:13.919
Town Hall: purposes, but not much written about it at this point, except their announcement.

592
02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:18.760
Town Hall: I think just one quick thing about that from Google's perspective

593
02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:33.290
Town Hall: changing the search experience is like an extraordinary ui shift right and a consumer behavior shift. So they have quite a bit at risk as well. So I know they've previewed. Gsc, right? But is that actually going to replace Google search?

594
02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:39.690
Town Hall: Do we like, do we know that for a fact? Right? Like.

595
02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:59.109
Town Hall: yeah, I mean, I I think you're gonna talk about getting off the wait list from the weekend right? If you try it. And if you search for something like best sectionals, their ads are actually still on top and below, is the generative AI answer, which goes direct like, which are direct product links to the sellers.

596
02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:19.829
Town Hall: So that like, if if they keep that hierarchy, that's still their business up top in terms of advertising on Google.

597
02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:23.210
Town Hall: is that going to be the future state.

598
02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:32.300
Town Hall: probably something close to that, I think. Matt and I were comparing our phones. He doesn't have access to search apps yet, and we're just comparing what the search results look like.

599
02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:44.309
Town Hall: They're shifting more towards what mine looked like in search Leds and away from what he was seeing. So I think they're actively migrating in that direction where? to your point,

600
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:53.270
Town Hall: links are still being shown right? But the answer is more, much more prominent. The tradition of blue links are going away almost entirely.

601
02:10:56.010 --> 02:11:02.329
Town Hall: I I I could find it. But Google has to figure out how to maintain. It's 150 billion dollars

602
02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:05.479
Town Hall: search, click revenue business

603
02:11:05.690 --> 02:11:08.159
Town Hall: while still giving better results.

604
02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:20.569
Town Hall: It it's not easy. And I, I was listening to a podcast about the Google product manager. Like every 2 weeks, they're dropping something new and playing and playing. And it feels like the Google people actually working now for the first time in about 10 years.

605
02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:29.879
Town Hall: Yeah, no. And they think that. And as you were mentioning at least in the I. O the he search as we're very, very prominent for an I think they did an e-commerce search.

606
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:36.069
Town Hall: and it was her bikes, and it was very prominent above and below. So I think that that's their priority right now.

607
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:55.819
Town Hall: in organic. But the regular, I think, where we're talking about losing traffic is going to be those regular links where people would often leverage to drive evergreen content. Then, you know, uphold their the news content? Right? So that's that's where we're going to see a lot of decline. And that's where the traffic isn't declined.

608
02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:02.829
Town Hall: I think discover is going to.

609
02:12:03.670 --> 02:12:11.450
Town Hall: I think the way that we think about discover is going to change right now. We think about it, at least to the mail as its own sort of traffic channel, right? And we look at it.

610
02:12:11.470 --> 02:12:20.720
Town Hall: And it's part of the overall Google ecosystem. What I think is gonna happen is that Google discover is going to be much more integrated into overall search

611
02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:45.029
Town Hall: because overall. So just going to be much more personalized, and which is the the whole goal of discover, since it was launched in like 2,016, and over the course in 2,016 to now, it's really been working hard, and it's own using its own sort of rank frame or whatever to personalize the those results. And that's why. Sometimes you'll see the feed, and it's like these super random sites. But they're very, very tailored to you. So I think we're going to see that integrated more.

612
02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.400
Town Hall: so I think just thinking about discover is going to change.

613
02:12:49.170 --> 02:12:49.860
So.

614
02:12:53.970 --> 02:12:57.780
But it in large part, because for okay.

615
02:12:59.190 --> 02:13:02.559
Town Hall: that that's finding it as well.

616
02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:07.830
Town Hall: That's the finish. or or

617
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:20.389
Town Hall: Hey, I'm Mark Howard. I didn't speak earlier. I'm former publisher. Worked with many of you in the past, been it many of these

618
02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:28.250
Town Hall: round tables, I think Matthew hit on a an interesting point that isn't really discussed. That much which is Google's obviously been

619
02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:43.880
Town Hall: killing in the search world forever. They're going to continue to need to grow those revenues. It's what drives their entire company. We don't really have much visibility yet in the what exactly their strategy is going to be for how that works. But you need to have that

620
02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:57.719
Town Hall: whole return of the paid plus the organic in order to drive the paid search business, so something has to emerge here to enable them to continue to have the massive growth that they

621
02:13:57.910 --> 02:14:11.370
Town Hall: always had. As this is the biggest part of their business. And I think, seeing what that ends up looking like is gonna dictate for a lot of us what our future holds in terms of some of this search traffic conversation

622
02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:26.479
Town Hall: right? Meaning the search product itself is gonna have to evolve. But it can't really exist unless it's got other places to direct people to besides the paid product. So

623
02:14:26.590 --> 02:14:38.499
Town Hall: the early displays of what they're showing with the minimal amount of referrals out like clearly that won't create an ecosystem that's robust enough for them to be able to grow the business from the place that it's at. Currently

624
02:14:42.650 --> 02:14:44.380
Town Hall: the charging for the links out.

625
02:14:47.590 --> 02:14:49.320
Yeah, Microsoft, that's also

626
02:14:51.940 --> 02:15:06.649
Town Hall: with the idea to charge for footnotes inside the being AI, and we all saw, I think, last week the announcement, they're moving. That conversation died, and where they're really banking is like integrating

627
02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:16.669
Town Hall: Gbt into the actual windows. OS, which was an interesting shift. But for a while they were talking heavily about ppc, essentially in the Chatbot.

628
02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:20.560
Town Hall: So so if Google

629
02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:32.839
Town Hall: dot com gets replaced in Q 4 on October first with google.com integrated with Bard. That's not good. Integrated with bard

630
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:34.200
Town Hall: then.

631
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:44.640
Town Hall: and traffic to all publishers on October second goes down 30, 40 50, because the majority of the answers get answered on barred.

632
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:55.619
Town Hall: Then what happens like what the publishers do? Do we wait till October second, or do you try to do things now as I have to plug in my computer.

633
02:16:01.610 --> 02:16:13.530
Town Hall: Sorry. Doesn't that also mean that the total address of ad mark? It's kind of shrunk to right? So yeah, this one. So

634
02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:18.600
Town Hall: from a revenue perspective with that. not matter

635
02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:28.179
Evan Simeone: to to whom. So it might, I mean to Google like, if they have people looking at it, then they can sell ads. The question is whether

636
02:16:28.270 --> 02:16:30.869
Evan Simeone: publishers will get those eyeballs.

637
02:16:34.730 --> 02:17:01.810
Town Hall: I I feel like there's also a question which we're sort of not really saying about users themselves, like what Google does is one thing, but like, how much will people engage with the chat versus just wanting to get the answer to their question, how much do they will they trust what the Gsc. Comes back with versus clicking out to a site that they know about and understand like, and you know, I don't think we know the answers to those questions and and how well what they're doing involved, like one of our SEO leads like is one of his theories is that

638
02:17:01.850 --> 02:17:04.320
Town Hall: people will chat more.

639
02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:20.679
Town Hall: click a lot, but click for faster periods like like you want your your time on page will go down because people will click out, be like, no, that's wrong. Come back, and that sort of experience will happen more often. So it's like, you know. Again, I think the the user experience that comes out of this is a big question that none of us know the answer to.

640
02:17:21.370 --> 02:17:34.670
Evan Simeone: So what do people think about the experience of using barred and using, you know, sort of chat based search like, just in as far as your personal user experience with it. Because I I thought that like.

641
02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:39.349
Evan Simeone: I mean, it was way too slow for most things that I would want to do and like

642
02:17:40.049 --> 02:17:43.400
Evan Simeone: regular Google, search is

643
02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:53.270
Evan Simeone: easier and faster to get the info that I want. I won't. I don't assume that it'll always be the case. But to other people have a different perspective.

644
02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:00.259
Town Hall: I mean, I've tried all 3, and I think that being AI and

645
02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:03.020
Town Hall: and bard, and

646
02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:09.920
Town Hall: a lot of this. The content seems often very, very curated. So whether it's like very general questions, like

647
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.779
Town Hall: of a general question like it just seems like it's it's not. It doesn't always give you the information you want.

648
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:32.520
Town Hall: I've also tried Gvc. To create recipes because I big on a side, and they're often very wrong, and if you don't know. I've been never done before, you're gonna get a real disaster. So it's not great. And even with the plugins, or with browsing with Gvt.

649
02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:40.089
Town Hall: It's very, very slow. It's often times out. So there's a lot of bugs that need to be worked out before

650
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:44.230
Town Hall: it's something that people rely on day to day. My opinion.

651
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:48.709
I think we're waiting for the

652
02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:56.860
Town Hall: the barred Api right that hasn't come out publicly yet. So I think for, for from the engineering perspective, I think.

653
02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.379
Town Hall: But we're some people are in it. Yeah.

654
02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:16.149
Town Hall: but from an engineering perspective, we don't really think about that ux rich, I think you're thinking, well, that ux that's there. Now, translate into the next generation. So we don't know the answer to that. you you should share what you said about

655
02:19:16.510 --> 02:19:21.089
Town Hall: how do they maintain that ad business without a mix of organic results?

656
02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:37.279
Town Hall: Yeah. Well, so last year they did a hundred 60 billion in search and 30 billion in Youtube, they can't lean on Youtube to make up the delta of cut in off that that revenue. So there's gonna have to be some variation of what this all looks like of

657
02:19:37.459 --> 02:19:59.209
Town Hall: paid plus organic that still gives users the end of the day, that that experience of being able to find the information in the form factor that they want right now, we were just saying that the experience itself is pretty poor overall rich and I were talking earlier most of the time. I use Bard. I still hit the Google it button at the bottom to actually get the answer I needed.

658
02:19:59.250 --> 02:20:04.890
Town Hall: but that will evolve. And and somehow they're gonna have to still create

659
02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:14.560
Town Hall: a search based experience to to grow those sort. That search revenue, the 160 billion is not going to grow if they just simply go to the the conversational

660
02:20:14.890 --> 02:20:16.040
Town Hall: experience.

661
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:23.860
Evan Simeone: But I mean, it's also possible they could fail. Right? It's not inevitable that they figure it out and continue to grow.

662
02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:38.090
Town Hall: I'd argue that it's inventor's dilemma with Google right now. Soft has everything to gain. They can completely change the experience because they're not worried about protecting that revenue.

663
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:52.120
Town Hall: That's the biggest part of play for Microsoft, because they can do whatever they want, they can risk it. No, they not afraid to do it. Google, on the other hand, has to be careful, and they have. But have they have to compete?

664
02:20:52.210 --> 02:21:10.629
Town Hall: So my Microsoft could kill their ad business kind of in a way. Right? Yeah. And the experience, I think that Microsoft is creating ready into all their price products. They're either doing it. It's a brilliant move from Microsoft to. But did you ever try to use bing for a week and not Google. See how bad the experiences. Well.

665
02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:23.019
Town Hall: I just did something where I was like looking for a very, very specific answer, and I clicked on probably 20 links in Google didn't get the answer I wanted. I went to Bing. I asked a very specific question. I got the answer immediately.

666
02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:36.270
Evan Simeone: Yeah, I've had a similar experience, or with duck go, which is based on bing, like more and more. I don't think it's very far. I mean, just classic search, like. I think Google is not really better anymore, anyway.

667
02:21:36.330 --> 02:21:46.790
Town Hall: But being can optimize their experience for user, remove all the ads and not lose that much revenue and basically, and that will that and Google. So you know, that's

668
02:21:46.860 --> 02:22:01.870
Town Hall: but we're also the 1% who are using this and care about this, the other 98% of the United States. They're just gonna probably still use Google, whatever it is and not be. It's clearly as advanced as we are.

669
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:03.920
Town Hall: unless Microsoft does a deal with apple.

670
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:12.350
Town Hall: Oh, to replace, replace search. So Bing replaces Google and the apple iphone

671
02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:16.489
Evan Simeone: like they were talking like Samsung is talking about doing right?

672
02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:17.820
Town Hall: Yeah.

673
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:25.570
Town Hall: So to so is one of the takeaways. Then we all need to become better friends with Microsoft

674
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:36.410
Town Hall: as they then figure out search because Google is not going to maintain, it's 95% share. It's going to go to Microsoft. And they're going to be sending traffic to publishers down the road.

675
02:22:36.450 --> 02:22:37.829
Evan Simeone: Yeah, I mean, baby.

676
02:22:38.350 --> 02:22:43.409
Evan Simeone: It's it's more of a possibility now than it was, you know, certainly. But

677
02:22:44.420 --> 02:23:00.389
Town Hall: who knows? I mean, Google is not going to go down without a fight. So I'd be careful ruling out Google on this. I think we are judging 2 companies based on the speed and velocity of which they roll out, and not the responsibility in which they roll out.

678
02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:03.260
Town Hall: And we've always said in this room

679
02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:06.899
who wins the company with the most engineers.

680
02:23:06.970 --> 02:23:09.910
Town Hall: If you put open AI versus Google.

681
02:23:09.930 --> 02:23:19.810
Town Hall: the answer is very clear on who has more resources. And so I suspect everything that we've seen about Judge Bt and open AI and the Microsoft stuff.

682
02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:27.180
Town Hall: Yeah, it's very impressive. But I would not rule out Google, like, I really wouldn't. They're doing the same productivity.

683
02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:41.670
Town Hall: enhancements with Google sheets and Docs and Gmail. I mean, we all are using. Many of us are using Gmail G suite is adopted. What? Broadly. I I just I wouldn't rule them out, and I bet you they're just going slower.

684
02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:44.340
Town Hall: Oh, what I was saying is, if if

685
02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:59.289
Town Hall: yeah, more money, there's industries that Microsoft's embedded in where there's a lot more money to be made in productivity enhancements, I mean finance. Category alone is probably what 8 times the size of media 10 times the size of media.

686
02:23:59.590 --> 02:24:22.580
Town Hall: I don't know which. You probably know the number, but like that, that's where I'm like. Microsoft is playing a slightly different game, I think. Yes. Well, they've less to lose from a consumer perspective. But on the Enterprise side, where that, you know, I would have thought office would have been gone 10 years ago. And yet it's still a massive money maker. People are still investing heavily because it's

687
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:43.490
Town Hall: it. It it's working for enterprise. So I I get your point about G suite. But I just think that outside of media where you know manufacturing, you know, enterprise type businesses. I think Microsoft has a a major leg up. And I think this AI push that there, the way they're integrating it is going to have a material impact on business.

688
02:24:49.280 --> 02:25:08.689
Town Hall: Yeah, I was actually gonna mention Meta, because I think they're actually their model is interesting. And and and to the point of what everybody's saying, like no one knows where this is going to go. Anyway, there's like the open source versus proprietary model, which is interesting. And Meta, as you know, on the perspective of open source. They took llama, which is their platform, gave it to the world, and you know we've seen it

689
02:25:08.690 --> 02:25:29.009
Town Hall: start happening already in the image world where there's stable diffusion. And as mid journey, mid journey is proprietary, close paid for, stable diffusion is open source, and I think mid journey. Most people would agree was better in the beginning and stable. That's usually now, because effectively, they have tens of thousands of developers around the world, just building stuff for it like is rapidly accelerating past my journey, where it's like

690
02:25:29.010 --> 02:25:45.029
Town Hall: the same thing could happen in the Lm world for a text where clearly, you know Bing, and you know, or or or Gpt and Bart are are better than lama right now, like Lama's already got a whole bunch of developers working on it because because Facebook gave it away and academics are working on them whatever. So like.

691
02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:50.669
Town Hall: you know, who who knows what's gonna happen? I think there's a lot of you know, things been thrown up in the air.

692
02:25:51.460 --> 02:26:03.929
Town Hall: What are you talking like today? Still, 96% of the United States uses Google to search for everything, whatever the number is, I mean, part partly, I mean, you know, to ask a sort of ridiculous open into question, like

693
02:26:03.970 --> 02:26:14.249
Town Hall: is search even a thing people use in 5 years? Or is there some different way that we're finding information that is very distinct from the way we do it today? Right. And and it could be just talking to your iphone

694
02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:17.959
Town Hall: right? Right? Talking to your iphone via Bing

695
02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:33.859
Town Hall: might be something that happens in 3 to 5 or or Alexis and echoes, which were, you know, sort of a novelty that everyone thought would be a big deal and wasn't really a big deal like maybe they become a big deal, because it's way better than it ever was before, because what happened when Matt, we then and I would play with Bart or chat.

696
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:38.230
Town Hall: you'd ask one. Prom, that's like he was just looking at it for airfare

697
02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:55.230
Town Hall: using Chat Gbt. With Kayak, and he would ask, I want to go to Boston for the weekend. And then Kaya came back, and he has 5 questions. you know, which weekend by yourself, what everything. And then you realize that typing those answers is silly. But talking, those answers is so efficient.

698
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:59.940
Town Hall: How much retail search.

699
02:27:01.210 --> 02:27:05.869
Evan Simeone: So yeah, I mean, what happens with search and like nobody. Nobody knows it, could

700
02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:28.889
Evan Simeone: it? It could be replaced by a different paradigm. But Though, you know those are sort of easier to come up with, and to actually perfect and make practical, like. Some people don't like talking to their phone, you know. And if you're in a place with a bunch of other people. It isn't practical, like all of these things seem like good ideas, and they might get some share. But, like, you know.

701
02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:32.489
Evan Simeone: Google, search works really really well.

702
02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:38.800
Evan Simeone: And and then this needs to be enough, better for people to switch

703
02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:45.709
Evan Simeone: and so that that is definitely possible, or it could be possible in the next couple of years.

704
02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:49.369
Evan Simeone: But it's not, I think, a foregone conclusion that it will be

705
02:27:54.600 --> 02:28:00.830
Town Hall: okay. So are there any takeaways for publishers based on this conversation?

706
02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:11.509
Town Hall: Or is it just like Google's not gonna know 95% of search down the road. And then couple of years, people are, gonna find it different to get information. And it's probably not going to be Google. Other competitors are finally going to merge.

707
02:28:12.030 --> 02:28:13.359
Town Hall: Is that what it is?

708
02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:18.730
Town Hall: All the smart people in the room.

709
02:28:18.780 --> 02:28:20.659
Evan Simeone: I mean, it's more likely than ever.

710
02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:25.630
Town Hall: Okay.

711
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:37.710
Town Hall: you're going back to your point. Of what do we do? If we lose 30 of the Referrals from Google right on October second. You gotta get direct traffic. That's the only thing.

712
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:48.330
Town Hall: And I think you know Freddie, he! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He! He had a good strategy. You said there is going to be a return to homepage. You can't get news from

713
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:58.590
Town Hall: on Facebook. You can't get news from Bard or Chat Gpt. There'll be a return, and you just better have a good one. and there'll be a process of people finding sources of

714
02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:00.340
Town Hall: of information.

715
02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:05.930
Town Hall: Yeah, I I think you're right. Yeah. If you have a good home page.

716
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:08.789
Town Hall: Which do you think that there's any

717
02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:22.499
Town Hall: so well, I I I I thought it was. That was the sense. Yeah. So I did analysis a month ago on Bard.

718
02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:27.029
Town Hall: And I said, how many articles were written yesterday.

719
02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:36.830
Town Hall: and after 10 or 15 prompts, I got to a number of 400,000 articles written in a day, and, like Google has that real answer, but it's very hard to get that out of it.

720
02:29:36.850 --> 02:29:38.659
Town Hall: And then I was saying, with

721
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:45.280
Town Hall: all the content that could be created in a year or 2 that 400,000 a day could go to 4 million.

722
02:29:45.390 --> 02:30:08.589
Town Hall: it could. It's the order of magnitude higher to 4 million. If there's 4 million articles in a day instead of 400,000 like, what does that mean? How do you find things? Does Google then still crawl those under 3.6 million. Does it realize half them are crap and ignores them, and then gives them a kick in the ass and say, I'm not looking at your domain again. I I it's the to point. There's just so much that can change

723
02:30:08.970 --> 02:30:10.890
Town Hall: that. It just gets it gets daunting.

724
02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:13.919
I I have thought your point.

725
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:25.499
Town Hall: My point was this, that if kind of not thinking about the formula, but thinking about the 400,000 that exist today, if the total amount of referral traffic is

726
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:39.690
Town Hall: I don't know 1 one to one today, and that goes down the total demand. It's a supply demand equation, right? So the total demand should go up for for ads, yeah, for a smaller supply. So

727
02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:44.620
Town Hall: so price will go up potentially.

728
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:56.299
Evan Simeone: But if people are just on Google, and they don't need to go elsewhere. Then Google can just sell those apps right? They're gonna have more time. I mean, it's you know.

729
02:30:57.030 --> 02:31:05.209
Evan Simeone: if it's where the eyeballs are. So the the risk is that people don't bother going to the site as much because they can just spend all their time on Google.

730
02:31:07.950 --> 02:31:09.270
I think

731
02:31:16.210 --> 02:31:18.120
it's hard to navigate.

732
02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:22.560
We apply

733
02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:26.610
Town Hall: host AI world where it gets 4 million.

734
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:27.950
Okay.

735
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:33.539
Town Hall: 4 million articles a day is just scary. If the number is 400,000 today.

736
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:45.019
Town Hall: Yeah, I I I like in this more to the death of the cookie. right where you you know, we've been talking about it, and it's still coming sort of maybe

737
02:31:45.340 --> 02:32:01.860
Town Hall: in some way, some way or form. But when I talk to agencies, they say for for places that have logged in users. I'm going to spend as much money as I can there as possible, and then I'm still gonna have money to spend, because I can't only reach

738
02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:25.270
Town Hall: 5 of users and keep buffalo wild wings in business. Right? So I've got to go to who's got probabilistic, who's got, you know, content adjacency. And so you find other ways, I think. Yes, the dollars are gonna spread. But there's gonna be a handful of of companies that get the 100 million dollar deals with Google or similar.

739
02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:28.510
Town Hall: not to single anybody out.

740
02:32:28.700 --> 02:32:41.770
Town Hall: Yeah. And and we'll get that demand. and the rest of us will get less. But that doesn't mean 0. And so what I'm trying to figure out is

741
02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:52.969
Town Hall: a how do I get to be in that privileged position? Because I want to be in that privileged position. And B, if it's going to be less, how much less. And how do I compensate for that with other products?

742
02:32:53.330 --> 02:33:18.590
Town Hall: My worry about the supply in the short term is, you hear this from other publishers, and the trades like building or being more productive, creating more content. I think Buzzfeed is a good example of this like build more and more content as much as possible. That's gonna drive revenue. That's just one example. I worry about that surplus of suppressing Cpms across the industry generally, and we're all going to be impacted by it. But eventually there's going to be a point

743
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:23.349
Town Hall: in which there's enough adoption of these AI chat bots

744
02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:49.550
Town Hall: for the end consumers that they will go to publishers less and less, and only go to the ones that are specifically for their interests or high premium. And so I think it's somewhat mobile and yes to the cookie, because this mobile created this surplus and supply that suppress cpms. And then the death of the cookie is going to pre minimize a smaller number of publishers that are going to have outsized weight in terms of pricing command.

745
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:59.980
Town Hall: And so I think like, that's the part where, if I was like to graph this out, a huge surplus of supplies come, as we're all trying to be more productive, which will really in more content.

746
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:07.090
Town Hall: And so, as supply increases, demand will decrease. And then eventually, when people don't go to, you know

747
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:19.629
Town Hall: no site number 5, 6, 7 that they normally go to, and they can just get that through a chat by the sites. One through 5 are going to be even more precious.

748
02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:28.100
Town Hall: It's certainly hard. but it's not impossible before. But but what's interesting is you talk about that surplus of supply.

749
02:34:28.290 --> 02:34:36.870
Town Hall: I'm sure we've all. And for you know, I think there are some SEO and growth experts here, and for everyone else. I'm sure you're all seeing

750
02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:41.530
Town Hall: creating more articles is being punished by the new Google algorithm

751
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:51.959
Town Hall: like, it's not about creating more. It used to be. You create some. You create a a bunch in the middle, and they do pretty well. And you you have some some spikes now. It's nothing spike.

752
02:34:52.100 --> 02:35:20.060
Town Hall: and and having more, just trains more content. Doesn't Spike just trains the Al go to listen to you less. So we're all seeing the same thing. That's not probably not news to anybody in this room. So I actually counter a little bit the increased supply and that Google has effectively acted like the fed they've raised. They've raised interest rates so that it's harder to get the value of of that, maybe preemptively.

753
02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:28.040
Town Hall: It might be a stupid question. But I guess.

754
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:50.779
Town Hall: yeah, I think this really interesting conversation. But when Google, over the last X number of years started to basically surface a lot of other content, like travel, content, or whatever in in in the search. Isn't that really what happened? This I mean, the the result here is that a lot they're gonna surface a lot more content within the search results. I mean, I'm I'm you guys are much more experts than than they do today.

755
02:35:50.970 --> 02:36:04.299
Town Hall: And and basically, people hope I mean, not hopefully, potentially are going to be satisfied and and move on right? So that's isn't it? Very similar to what happened? So really, the only way, I think, to avoid that is to not let them.

756
02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:15.780
Town Hall: You basically take our content and not, you know. you know, send things back out to us. And I know that's the same thing that a lot of the I I'm not an expert on this, but a lot of the travel sites and other sites for

757
02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:39.799
Town Hall: trying to do yelp over the past, you know, 10 years. So I guess I I don't really know about this. But what what is happening on that front, and what can we, or should we do as publishers that are paying people to create this content? And that's I mean, I I appreciate all this conversation about price and supply and demand. I think it's right, and I come for Buzzfeed. And I think you know Joan is doing a lot of interesting slash

758
02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:50.119
Town Hall: things. I probably wouldn't do there but But I think the bigger thing for us is, are we going to? What can we do? Should we do? Or we just gonna let it happen. You know

759
02:36:51.030 --> 02:37:02.809
Town Hall: why we're having this conversation. But I think it's it's getting more to sort of like the, you know, the Google Microsoft productivity. That's all. A totally different conversation, I think, from the Google Search perspective.

760
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:11.969
Town Hall: That's really, I mean, I don't know how much we could do here from a you know, at a trust, or whatever perspective, but like, that's really what's most top of my, I think. But maybe I'm wrong.

761
02:37:13.090 --> 02:37:14.369
Town Hall: Paul Bannister.

762
02:37:14.890 --> 02:37:35.069
Town Hall: I think if I'm hearing you correctly, like 0 click search is sort of what it is. And you know, 20 years ago, when you went to Google, everything was a link. And over time they started effectively, like commoditizing certain content types. What? 0 click search. So it's like you search for something and you don't click. So it's like, I think at this point, that's something like 50% of searches on Google don't result in a click.

763
02:37:35.070 --> 02:37:50.160
Town Hall: Because people 5 0. I think it's something. I may be wrong, but it's it's mid to. It's mid to double digits. It's a pretty big number. and that number has been like steadily increasing over the years. And it's very different by content type, whether

764
02:37:50.160 --> 02:38:11.310
Town Hall: you know Steve or others can probably comment on highly commoditized. And from Google's perspective, like you type in like, what's the weather in Albuquerque? And like, you don't need to go to acute weather anymore, because the results right there. That was true for support scores which Andrew on this might be able to talk about like things like that, or commoditize what was taken first in that zero-click world. I think the question with Bard and Gse. So if that

02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:27.439
Town Hall: percent of searches that don't result in a click has been kind of a steady inclined for years. Now is Q. 4. Like a hockey stick, where many forms of you know the deep investigative reporting is highly unlikely to be about. Commoditize that way like it. It can't be

766
02:38:28.050 --> 02:38:34.290
Town Hall: highly unlikely to be commoditized, but you need reporters to really dig in and do that like. Bots can't do that for you.

767
02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:36.100
Town Hall: But aside from that.

768
02:38:36.170 --> 02:38:49.979
Town Hall: what are the other forms of content that will be commoditized sooner rather than later, like, I think I think travel is a good example where it's like, and partly because, like Tripadvisor is terrible. In my opinion, it's just as you know, as a point. But like typing in, you know, I'm going to Paris.

02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:57.360
Town Hall: Here's my family. Here's how long we're going for. Give me 4 recommendations like, it's really pretty good at giving you this kind of answers and and giving you inspiration.

770
02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:06.660
Town Hall: Does travel. 0 click starts start increasing rapidly. What other content verticals are going to be affected that way? So I think then it's like thinking about what verticals it could affect.

771
02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:24.620
Town Hall: and thinking about with them. If you have content there, how do I produce different kinds or better content? That is less likely to be commoditized and more likely to require a click to get the answer, I think, is with Google must be aware that if they can answer all the questions all the time, and no one goes anywhere else

772
02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:27.389
Town Hall: that that's going to be bad for them in the long run.

773
02:39:27.490 --> 02:39:36.240
Town Hall: So somewhere. They must say we're 50%. The most we're going to get to is 54%. In 2 years we go to 60%. But in the external pressure.
